Daily Discussion, June 28, 2018 -- TITLE
50% under the dickline now
I think the data combined with the comments on here tell us one concrete fact -- no one on here has any fucking clue what BTC is doing, or why.
Good morning bitcoin! So are we in a calm before the storm scenario? Who knows! 
Christ, at this rate I'll be giving HJs in the alley for crack in no time
Largest crypto event in history. Tickets going for $334 [USD payment only.](https://imgur.com/a/Bvl3TSL) That says it all folks. The people trying to convince you to buy more crypto don't even believe in it and won't take it for payment. 
Feels like the band on the Titanic... Gentlemen, it has been a privilege trying to increase adoption. 
I don't even know what to do. Am I gonna regret not having bought cheap Bitcoin for $5.8K when it's at $15k in a few months. Or am I gonna regret not having sold at $5.8K when it's down to $3K in a few months?
Bitcoin will fall and fall until lightning works. The whole point of not increasing block size was for Lightning. Than we finally got people to try bitcoin last September to December and the fees went to $50. 
They sold and didn’t like bitcoin’s fees. Bitcoin won’t get many chances like that again. Lightning needs to be operational or there be no users to use it this century. 
Common sense has to prevail. Fees equal no adoption which equals useless currency not trusted. 
i might be losing all my money, but its not all bad...

at least i don't have to eat my dick
I'm going to Fuddruckers and have a scotch on the rocks
The year is 2048, your son asks you why you bought them a Fiat to drive and not a Lambo like his friend Larry’s dad bought. 
it's all my fault, I'm sorry.

You see .... it looked sort of stuck at 7.5k for weeks.  I mean, it wasn't moving.

I thought it might be dead so I decided to check by poking it with a stick ......
Let me be the first to say it.  6k never again.
I dunno if anyone is like myself... I hang on the cliffs of this game.  But I’ve learned to sit down.  Watch.  Tell my wife how (we should feel about this). But I’m more at peace right now for some reason than I’ve ever been.  It’s all because of a comment I heard 3 months ago...  “we should hold onto it... you know they want to get rich again”. 
In here is starting to get grim, which means bitcoin is starting to become an interesting prospect again :) 
I joke around a lot, but I'm honestly not worried. I know it's going to go up by a lot again soon. And when it does, we'll all be tougher.. and yay, a bit wiser. For we have endured the Bitcoin battles
ho lee fuk!

now below $5800

😭😭😭😭😭😭
a 40&#37; down day is coming....it's just a matter of time before panic sets in and the big boys are no longer able to slowly dump their positions.
Look, NOBODY makes real gains from jumping on board when there's no risk. It's when it's scary and most people wouldn't touch it with a ten foot pole that you buy, not when it's all smooth sailing and a comfortable decision. By then it's too late. 
wow bitcoin just dipped under 6k again?
Prozac in the morning, Wellbutrin at noon, Adderall in the evening!
This is good for Bitcoin...
still enjoying the ride. 

btw i like bitcoin very much 
What a rollercoaster we are on. 
Where gonna see green tomorrow morning, these prices are ridiculous. Cardano .11 cents. There's easy doubles everywhere. No way Bulls can pass this up. 
What are you guys bitching about?  A year ago it was around a grand now it’s 6 grand lol 

Tell me where else could you put your money to go 6x?

Did you buy it at 19k?  Guess what, you gotta wait a year or two.  Big deal
If there's one thing I hate about this place, it's how wishy-washy it is.

When market sentiment is negative, every authoritarian-socialist enemy of freedom is in here gloating that the global economic crisis has been averted. 

When it's positive, we get shit all but Lamborghini moon rockets and Vegeta memes. 

Am I the only one who doesn't give a fuck? So the price goes up, yay money I guess? How about ending tyranny? How about what Bitcoin is doing for the greater good in Venezuela? "Nah fam I just wanna get rich." If you think like this, I actually hate you.

As for you people who just want to see us burn for one reason or another... two words: "Pandora's box". Cryptocurrency has been invented; improvements are being made. If it's not Bitcoin, it'll be something else.

I *don't* hate you guys. I understand. One day, the state will be powerless to control money, and we will be truly free. The end of government will be scary. Millions will die. But those of us left will be free.

Can anyone make me feel better about all the money ive lost?
Welcome back to the year 2014...

&nbsp;

It's accumulation time boiz
You guys are seriously getting worked up in here. I'm going to provide a quick history lesson. Watch this video it's only a couple of minutes and look at historical volatility. There's absolutely nothing concerning going on right now. If we blow through 5000 could be a potentially different situation but it just hasn't happened https://youtu.be/p5ARJEOXORM
Just remember that all the people telling you that Bitcoin is dead are the people who get their knowledge from watching cable news shows.  The lower Bitcoin goes the more you should want to buy it.  The only thing that can stop Bitcoin is thermonuclear world war.  
BLOCKCHAIN IS THE BUBBLE.

  
I've thought this for a while and now I am hearing it being said more often. Here is a comment I posted summarizing my logic on this.  
Saying blockchain is the real bubble and not Bitcoin - It's like saying the endless list of companies that jumped on the dot com bandwagon, adding the dot com online portion of business to their model without any real implementation of it were a bubble, but some companies such as Amazon were the real deal.  
Very similarly, recently there was a wave of companies that added 'blockchain' to their business model and saw a surge in stock price only to crash again shortly after. There was also a wave of ICOs, raising millions on nothing but the concept of a blockchain project. But Bitcoin, the real original and functional blockchain, running stable with 99.99&#37; up time for 10 years and not one transaction compromised, is amazing.

  
I think many have been getting it wrong - Bitcoin is not the bubble, blockchain is. Bitcoin just had a bubble period in its price growth during the awareness stage in late 2017. It's still on the rise and only now beginning to see real progress in terms of infrastructure and real adoption.

Thoughts?
Heads up for all the "Tulip Mania" analogies, it's a myth.

Good day everybody! 
Who the fuck said 6000 is a strong support? LOL

Bought at 15k. Gonna end it all at this point. I put my whole life savings into it. Goodbye everyone 
Don't worry that bitcoin is this low. They can just do more forks. Bitcoin Gold, bitcoin silver, bitcoin platinum, bitcoin diamond, bitcoin kryptonite, bitcoin yourmom. There are an infinite number of bitcoins they can make so it's all good. 

$5k bitcoin * 4 versions of it = $20k, so it's back to an ALL TIME HIGH. Yea baby!!!!!
 A *Ponzi scheme* is an investment fraud that pays existing investors with funds collected from new investors. 
With the market slipping, and China's market on the verge of a meltdown, I think we may have to wait a little longer for a big turn around. I don't think we can expect a lot of money coming in. This is not the time investors are gonna take risks either. And if things get worse, there's not gonna be a lot of people with much extra cash to use to take chances on crypto. 
The Greater Fool

Late last year a number of us were warning that Bitcoin was an obvious bubble.  Those warnings were routinely dismissed (you don't understand the technology! but the blockchain! there are only 21 Million coins, blah blah blah, etc etc etc).

As soon as we said this is LIKE Tulips, or Beanie Babies or other speculative bubbles with no real foundation in value we were greeted with endless drivel about how it this couldn't possibly be like Tulips (tulips are flowers you fucking moron) or Beanie Babies (this is a distributive ledger, not stuffed animals).  

All of that was quite besides the point and completely missed how it was like those speculative bubbles - which ALL work in exactly the same way on the way up when emotion takes over and there is always a greater fool, driving the price even further. . .and that momentum itself creates greater fools.  

And they all end the same way - they run out of fools.  Eventually the idiots at the top are the ones stuck, and the whole thing collapses.  Has nothing to do with the underlying asset is - that's just the MaGuffin.  It could literally be anything, Tulips, Beanie Babies. . .digital chits. . .

Anyway, the rest is history, it's now 1/3rds ATH headed to 1/4 ATH. . .

Could this give away all gains in the last 12 months?  You bet.  

Could this take years to build back any confidence - undeniably it will. 

Could something happen in those next couple of years that drive it to nothing?  Maybe more likely than not.

That's not to say, don't play this game - if you have fun - do it!  Just make sure you're playing with Monopoly money.  Money that you literally do not need for any reason at all - and wouldn't care if it disappeared.  

This is a lottery ticket.  You may make some money, probably not, only use mad money and you'll be fine.
The dream is dead. I tried to believe for awhile but I am out. This market is controlled and FUD makes the rules. This is forever a bear's playground.  Either being told there is no point in mining and no there is not enough to the moon to keep throwing money at this without some stability. I want to be wrong but eh and I hate to sound like that never 10k guy who trolls here but Bitcoin is dead. To those who still have the stomach and the pockets to keep this up I wish you luck. 
[deleted]
Discussion question for old timers: Is the rhetoric and general feeling the same during this "crash" as previous "crashes?" 

I feel just fine about the price. I started about a year ago and on average am up in that time period more than any other investment that I would have considered, even though I bought some well above 10K. We have a lot of statements made about "this crash is different than the last" or "this crash is the same as the last." I'm curious if the general mood and vitriol on both sides was similar during previous crashes?
Could a rough evening..

Have you folks noticed the sudden increase in number of China based exchanges?

There is now [ZB.COM](https://ZB.COM), BigONE, Coinsuper, etc.  

And frankly, I cannot believe that an exchange can pop up overnight and start processing over $250m of cryptos.

Didn't China clamped down on these shady exchanges months ago?
Second straight month of declines. 20 % down 
what is the next price support?
last call to sell at $6k, train is leaving the station.  Magic 8 ball says "in 6 months you'll be looking at $3500 wishing you could get $6000"
Trump will be good for Bitcoin they said. Record highs by July they said. 

They didn't know shit
I can't wait to see how stupid you people that announce Bitcoin is dead will all be feeling a year from now...
Okay, so here's a question: If bitcoin price goes so low that mining is unprofitable then people will stop mining (This is specially true after the halvening). If people stop mining then it'll be very easy for someone to have 51%+ of the hash right? And if that happens then wouldn't bitcoin instantly become 100% worthless and die on the spot?. Am I missing something here? 

This means that as the price goes lower we steadily approach the one true death of Bitcoin, unless there is something about the system that I don't understand. 
This is weird. The price is steady at 6100 all day so far. 
OK Guys now listen!
The price is under 6000 right now, yes! BUT the bottom is 6000. Trust me!
Why so much doom and gloom today? I just walked into a random convenience store and paid for my snacks with lightning network. The owner of the store was gushing about how much money he is saving on transaction fees ever since he's started accepting it. Mass adoption is here, people, and the future is BRIGHT.
i think the more significant thing about the high of 20k was like holy shit, it went to 20k, do you realize how much of a big deal that is?  Now the only question is how long until the next ATH and then how high will it go.  This is the birth of a industry.  
if the 1day chart pattern holds, we might see 5.5k in the upcoming months, blah
Rational behavior 101, don't spend anything you think is going to go up in value which is the very thing preventing bitcoin from being used as a currency. Even with Segwit and Lightning Network coming out people still don't have a want or need to use bitcoin to buy goods and services except maybe some bitcoin rollercoaster meme stickers to show "mass adoption" is here. I hate to plug my investments, but if someone said hey I'll sell you an xbox for 5 shares of MU stock, I would tell them no way because Micron is going to go up 30&#37; by next year. Bitcoin is no different and provides an excellent example of why some inflation is a good thing when it comes to currencies.
Bitcoin is being smashed because of the insecure exchanges and  the report from the International Bank of Settlements.

BTC/USD will be below $100 by 2020. Biggest nonsensical mania since tulips in Holland. 


Fuck futures and fuck Wall Street.  That is all.

There was a time where people bought rocks as pets.

There was a time where people paid $2,000 for a beanie baby.

There was a time where people exchanged 10 acres of farmland for a tulip.

Bitcoin is not the first irrational bubble.
Surprised it still this high. My guess is 2-3K by end of year. 


scary stuff https://imgur.com/8Gqzsmf

A few more hours and something will happen.
Guys, what's the prediction will see today 6k or will go up?

under 6k watch that bitcoin fly!
dang going down again lol
I’m going to up the ante 5900 never again.

Should see some upside from here
I know market confidence is low, but the price for Bitcoin is, relatively, cheap. Maybe this situation will play out like the end of April when there was that sudden bullrun of a $1K increase in less than 30 minutes and then it went up to $9000. Possibly next week?!
I think it is looking pretty good - seriously.

I have a portfolio of serious coins - no shitcoins (well, OK, I have 2% just for fun.)

My portfolio is - marginally - climbing.

BTC may be falling a lttile, but look at the shitcoins and lying coins plummet - look at Bcash !

I'm v. positive about BTC.  This looks slow, but it is very fast moving technologically and financially.

if you need some inspiration to hold watch the first 12 minutes of this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYwA0TYPaQ0.  Recent interviews with ppl in the industry.  should help you see the long term picture better
The internet started in the 60s and finally made it into homes as a slow dial up service in the 90s. Then well into the 2000s we get decent speeds and bandwidth. 

What took 40 years then, can be done in about 15 years or less today, thanks to the speed and connectivity of the very network platform that the internet provides.

Now consider that most people only started hearing about Bitcoin less than a year ago.

Today's edition is not really about price.  It is about how crypto is being developed and received in key parts of the world.

We are at the early stages of something that is going to be huge!

Have you ever watched the CNBC Africa's Crypto Trader show on youtube?  They usually discuss price with prominent leaders of the crypto community.  Recently they spent some time visiting different places in the world where crypto has gained traction.  Take a look:

Ok guys, we going to take back that hill .... $100 at a time.
if it's any consolation, people sold their homes to buy bitcoin at 20k, so if you have food to eat and shelter, then you should be happy!

Then there is this article -- [https://www.ccn.com/wolf-of-wall-street-jordan-belfort-claims-bitcoin-market-has-run-out-of-fools/](https://www.ccn.com/wolf-of-wall-street-jordan-belfort-claims-bitcoin-market-has-run-out-of-fools/)
We're about due for a dump. 
If compares to tulip bubble, we all know where it ends.

If compares to dotcom "bubble" around 1999/2000, there were two kinds of result.  there was Novell (& others) and there was Amazon (& others), the chart looks very similar if we comparing 1999/2000(dotcom stocks) to 2017/2018(Bitcoin). 

we really just don't know which way bitcoin will go .  it could be amazon , it could be Novell. it also could be RIM black berry though, aha, this is the third possibility. 
We're holding steady at 5800. Bulls are back!
It isn't even close to done correcting. 3k maybe.  LN baited everyone but it needs time and work.  
Let me make it clear!
Who says Bitcoin is dead is also saying gold is dead!
Can you pay with gold? Si claro. But would you? Only If you had to. 
So Stop thinking Bitcoin will ever be a currency. It is going to replace 1/4 of the gold reserves.
What that means? 1 Bitcoin is going to be something around 250 000 Dollar. 
Bitcoin is here to stay. But not as a currency rather the digital gold! 

To be honest i dont give a fuck If you hodl or Shit. To me all the "hodlers" sound like some stupid assholes.

What i am trying to tell you here is, If you want you can sell. There is nothing wrong with it. Anytime soon when you are liquid again you can buy and invest in the digital gold.

So stay relaxed and ACT like a man. Make your choice Brothers and Sisters.

I think we are going up in the next hour, we are in the edge of a triangle. My thoughts (RSI, market feeling...) we are breaking it with a beatiful green one. 
Another big move incoming. The eagle. 
I believe the bull run will start after G20 regulations are in place July 2018 (their self imposed deadline) opening the door to big investors and institutions. Thoughts anyone? More info known on this?
Anyone have a link to those posts about Alice using LN to pay for dinner?

I'm trying to find them but the search function's not turning them up.

Edit: nevermind, it was Carol. No wonder I couldn't find them!
has thw price froze?

Scared money don’t make no money 
So the new high is 5.8k now? Bullish(Bullshit)
Getting closer to my 4.5k call in july.
buttcoin is going down down down.. we will see it at 3.5k u heard it first from moaaaaaa.
There will be books written one day about the Bitcoin scam. It will be a bigger story than Enron.

Bottemed out
Some investors are predicting a corrective rally. 
Guys, people were cashing out their BTC to get the new Drake album. It's out now! Time for moon!
We are going sideways for too long, the incline of the price is just steeeper and steeper and and the giant selloffs are weaker and weaker... We are bottoming. Target constant bottom will be 5800-6000
Have we reached the bottom yet?
I would worry clif high said 💯 k bitcoin this year so just hodl 
Nom nom nom tasty bitcoin
And trigger volume 
Apparently a couple lines of code can proof double spending on an exchange not named. Cool reporting. Solid all around.

Followed by buy orders...
Troll #1
Bitcoin does what Bitcoin does. You can either hold and live as usual, then revisit when Bitcoin hits the rest of the world through spin off effect and infrastructure...or you can try and trade and stress on a daily basis. :)
Big if true!
BTC has a slow sink going, fact. How long that will last nobody knows, fact. Whether it will turn around at all is something that nobody knows, fact. So, actually we know quite a bit.
Soon weekend comes and probably ,we will see dump again
Yes according to clif highs new report around Middle of July we’re Going to experience a turnaround in  emotional values that e tends to October. That’ll dwarf last December. Rises in prices. And the cycles will become evident. Get in now people the herd is on its way . You have two months to get everything you own and the dog and old lady into this market before all hell breaks loose. Screenshot this. 
Will u accept bitcoin?
LOL! Now *that's* funny.
Infrastructure and public perception are not quite ready for mainstream Bitcoin payments quite yet, just give it time. The store of value property will kick in first and then an alternative payment to fiat. The replacement of fiat is not even in sight yet but that's probably coming one day dar off as well.
Someone should make a bot for the keyword "Titanic" to see how many times that's been said here over the years.

Close the tabs. Stop refreshing. Go outside.
Try doing nothing and being pleased in a few years.
Both
15k in a few month is rather unlikely. While the other case...
regretters gonna regret.
Exactly! Bitcoin got it's chance to be adopted and failed last December. Segwit alone will not cut it this time. We need LN asap!
What you are saying is not common sense at all. You really think people who bought Bitcoin in hopes they'd double or triple their investment sold it because of speed or transaction fees? Really??

You're talking about Bitcoin like you just starting to get involved in it last year and expect the whole integration of Bitcoin to happen in a year lol. It takes way way longer than that, just as all disruptive tech has before. Bitcoin will almost certainly progress. And if you talk with developers who contribute to the open source code or look at how many times anything in the past has developed, you'll see that very little is ever accomplished without trying things and testing upgrades...because that's how you get it right..you fail a few times.

The other problem here is that you're evaluating the entire network and tech based on your emotional response to the price of the token. That's not common sense, that's not even sane.
McAfee is already preparing for his exit scam by poisoning himself.
Well son when you have fiat you buy a fiat, and when you have bitcoins you buy a lambo.
Who the fuck buys his kid a lambo?

This kills the kid.
But we dont know who the Larry going to be. Someone from us who invested in bitcoin or someone who is watching this circus from outside and laughing at us? 
Doubtful -- I actually think it will make a run towards 7000 before settling back into the mid-5000s for a couple of months (some of this will be pump-and-dump for folks trying to get out, but still the result will be the same).
Sorry heard that one before your like the millionth one to say it.
Let me be the first to ask you. Which body part would you like to wager?
Smart attitude. Making any kind of opinion based on day to day ...or even month to month price movement in such incredibly early days of  this thing is insane.
Wow!! That is an awesome quote haha. I am also more at peace now than last month even though the market is a lot worse now.
Did you buy some Lehman Bros stock on the way out too? 
Things were grim at Enron as well.
It can get Grimer.

When you replace the smiley faces in your posts with capitalised words then we will know!
See you in 10 years. Maybe segwit will be at 60% than 
It's not gone below $5800.
BINGO!!!!!   

You sir are a genius,  don't let anybody tell you otherwise.  This is the most succinct summary of the current state of affairs I've read all week. 
Absolutely 
NO!! You buy when you understand the technology. 
Are you actually surprised?
Who in their right mind would take Adderall in the evening?
Yup, just like being on a bicycle going downhill, couldn't be easier!
Fun fact, a rollercoaster gains all of its potential kinetic energy on its initial climb. It never exceeds the height from the initial drop. 
What I've said all along -- why get off 2/3rds of the way down when you can ride it completely to the bottom?
I don't think catching a falling knife is a good idea with Bitcoin dangerously close to a long squeeze.
Go all in!!! Easy doubles. You'd be insane not to be all in.
It's not done yet.
first people said look at 6 month ago, now they say a year ago and soon they'll say look 2 years ago. No matter what happens some people are always up.
Ummm, that was before a crash where zillions of people literally lost billions of dollars. Not quiiiiiite the same.
Wrong
What happens in 2 years?
That's silly, they don't have to wait 2 years to lose all their money
^ what he said. Perhaps the most sane logical thing I've read in here in weeks.
more like you have to wait forever, the price will never rise above 10k again
Venezuela is the result of fiscal mismanagement and if you feel that's a good use case for BTC, fine - I got no arguments against it.

For rest of the world, the current financial system works just fine.  And to wish death upon millions - you are a lunatic.  Free?  Free of what?  The alternative to government is chaos.  Name me please one example of a truly free society in all of history that thrived and prospered.

You think cryptos is the answer?  Well, think again where the price of BTC is being decided.  90&#37; of the trading is carried out on shady exchanges in China and if you think the price is truly market driven, then you are naive and stupid.
You have to define what it means when things go up.. I think when prices go up for 1%, people get lamborection
#Postbitcoincrashmaniacsyndrome

This happens when people like yourself who, indeed, are in it for money like everyone else, start to advocate how good the technology is and how they hate others who like money. Anyone who has or had invested in crypto, has or had an urge to gain financial benefits out of it. I hate those who say they only love bitcoin for the sake of it and have nothing to do with money. 
Idiots like you are the reason I love watching crypto crash and burn. 
What did I tell you?!  If you're gonna troll at least call it Bitcoin Core!
Misery Loves Company?
just think of all the money you're going to make

No. Gambling comes with risks. You’re betting that bitcoin becomes the new global currency. It may or it may not. 
If it’s not realized it isn’t lost 🤟🏻
I've been accumulating as much as I can for way too long.  Bitcoin and Gold/Silver have been taking a shit for so long that I have no more money to put into my favorite things!
Yep, good time to put some Montgomery Wards and Lehman Brothers shares into the old safe deposit box for retirement.
Like you were there
cant wait to see you post the exact same thing but for when its sub 5000
Most people who say Bitcoin is dead don't have a clue about what's going on around the globe and are focused on short term token prices.
And those Iraqi dinars are about to RV too!
You could easily just link your better news/info here instead of this.

The contrary view -- [https://www.ccn.com/wolf-of-wall-street-jordan-belfort-claims-bitcoin-market-has-run-out-of-fools/](https://www.ccn.com/wolf-of-wall-street-jordan-belfort-claims-bitcoin-market-has-run-out-of-fools/)
Great read, thank you for posting it. 
What's your point here?  That article is busting the myth that tulip mania was widespread, or that it caused a giant financial crisis.  It does not dispute that there was a tulip bubble, where prices rose and rose until suddenly they didn't.  Its position as the prototypical bubble isn't changed by the article.  They weren't worth what people thought, and the bottom dropped out, a pattern that has played out many times since
> , revealing that while the 1630s did see a speculative bubble in tulip prices, neither the height of the bubble nor its bursting were anywhere near as dramatic as we tend to think.


The world would be so much better if people would actually read the real thing and not some biased news article... All you had to do is read a few sentences about the book. I hope bitcoin will get you to the moon, your education probably won't. 
This article says the tulip trade wasn't a myth, just that its economic impact was very minor.
This headline is so fucking stupid.

1.  Not a myth.

2.  It didn't involve everyone doesn't mean it didn't involve investors.  Just like bitcoin, only a relatively small number of nerds have bought into this nonsense.  That doesn't mean the consequences to them aren't very significant.

3. The overall economic repercussions were minor.  As the repercussions of the bitcoin bubble crash have almost no impact to the overall economy.  Bitcoin is a just non-player in terms of overall world economy.

Here's what's not a myth:

1.  Merchants did engage in a tulip trade which commanded fantastic prices for a short period of time.

2. The market did ultimately collapse when they ran out of greater fools.  



And a good day to you Sir!
it was. we tested it many times and bounced back from it. 
ayyy sell to me direct.  i'll make things out of toothpicks for you or somethin
Dont you still have like 41% of those "savings" left? Put it all on black before ending it

Or wait a year or two and see if halvening helps you out
Don't blame yourself. We're actively warning people not to do this shit, but you still have people on here pumping it and saying it will make you rich if you simply buy it and wait around. If you say otherwise you're a 'fuder'.

Good luck earning it back in one way or another. 
I bought in at $300. I feel great. I don't feel your pain at all.

I bet you'll buy back in when it reaches 15k again.
You can either sell it when it goes back to 15k or you can hold it and sell it higher. 15k wasn't even a year ago and Bitcoin is only now becoming a real thing, showing up in the financial segment of news casts, getting infrastructure built etc. Unless you desperately need the cash don't sell at a loss.
Bitcoinyourmom is the low cost option that everyone can buy and use.
Let me photocopy some USD notes and go deposit into my bank account daily. I'm sure the bank would accept these printed notes that I did myself. That's what you said right?
Market manipulation and opportunists are not ponzi schemes. Bitcoin is a blockchain network based on open source software. Don't be another broken record of false claims of ponzi schemes and tulips. 
Even if you feel what's going on with the token price is manipulation, that doesn't make bitcoin itself a ponzi, that's just human greed taking advantage of an opportunity.
Sounds like the stock market
Sounds like pension and tax system when having a children.
I wouldn't be so sure about that. These are times when a hedge like Bitcoin may be the perfect alternative for many. Especially now that it is at bottom prices. It lines up perfectly!  
A weaker Chinese currency in the months ahead would be a time that Bitcoin's store of value property could start looking a lot more attractive.
Stop trolling when the price is down and a lot of people have lost money.  This is not nice and karma is a thing.
You speak as though you are the leader of todays FUD army attack.

How do you guys get paid anyway? In Monopoly money?
Fawk sakes don't you pessimists ever get tired of your own crap? So what, early investors are taking profits. Your post is extremely premature. You may like the false feeling of power this whole "I told you so" gives you, but you'll need to wait until at least this time next year to see how this plays out 
How many millions did you make shorting?
The main problem is confidence that was damaged in December. We spent years trying to get people to just try it and they finally did and paid $50 to transfer $2 to their family as a test. Currency cannot exist without trust. It’s why the $ can be printed with ease, TRUST! 

This may take a generation to recover from. The lag in the technology may need that time. The devs got rich and bounced it looks like. Never seen anything take so long to develop. The internet was developed faster. 
hey, it sucks

i'm HODLing for now

but i'm already in the red, and i'm gonna feel even dumber if it goes to less than 5K (which seems likely)

😭😭😭
It died again?  Please submit an obituary for us.  Thanks.

[https://99bitcoins.com/obituary-stats/](https://99bitcoins.com/obituary-stats/)
Thanks buddy.  I have both. I’ll see you in 8 days 
Man, so this is what the weak hands look like in real time. Just take a break. Leave your money where it is. That's my opinion, at least.
Thanks. 
👋 
Good call. You know things are bad when even wanton tether printing can't keep the price afloat.
I bought about 100 btc when it was around $2-3

I sold it at around $9 and thought I was a fuckin slick rick, haha.  In my defense, at the time, it was total fucking mania.  Really no different than buying $1k and selling $5k.

Anyway, the price continued to climb to $1200, and I watched from the bleachers,

It tumbled, tumbled, tumbled, and I was glad not to be a part of it, because I was a total chicken little - 'The sky is falling!' - at every price $20+.  It was cathartic in some way being vindicated, even though the price was settled WAY higher than I had bought.

My brother had bought me 1 btc at $90 as an xmas gift that year.  I felt SUPER bad about it and tried to talk him out.  "You're wasting your money.... but thank you so much anyway..."  It was a generous gift, but I knew deep down he was way overpaying.

Anyway I held that btc and sold it on gyft to buy a gamestop gift card and bought an xbox one at launch, with change leftover.  I was happy for that.

Idk where I was going with this but that was basically my story.  Did it feel different?  Not a bit.  Think in terms of percentages, and it was basically the exact same.  People tell me I am insane for having sold at $9, but they are incapable of relating it back to real terms, the equivalent of having bought at $4k and selling at $18k.  

The USD-BTC raw quantities make no matter in this regard, because even back in those days, people were investing tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars into it.  People pretend bitcoin mania did not hit until 2017 but it was very very real in 2013.  

Anyway, yeah, it's just about all the same, and it hurts just as much.

As a side note, in the past couple years I invested about $12000 into Ignite Restaurant Group (IRG), and lost every penny.  I've since learned a very costly lesson about cutting losses short and not being emotional.  Like every gambler eventually says, "What I wouldn't do to be down *just* 50% again..."


Yes, the crash is different because of the volume of Bitcoins or rather the amount of "fiat" that was traded prior to it. Eventually it won't be possible for these very high price spikes to keep happening because there just won't be enough money flowing in. Perhaps this was the last spike. See the [hype graph](https://blogs.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/files/2017/08/Emerging-Technology-Hype-Cycle-for-2017_Infographic_R6A.jpg). It's possible we've crossed peak hype for crypto currencies and Bitcoin might plateau.

There's a general rule with investing into what seems to be a good deal: If people on the street that have nothing to do with finance (or technology) start talking about it, it's too late to buy in. By then, you missed the early adopter stage and might be one of those that never get their money back.
Here...  let me help with a real answer:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/22qc1d/as\_someone\_who\_has\_invested\_140k\_into\_bitcoin\_i/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/22qc1d/as_someone_who_has_invested_140k_into_bitcoin_i/)
same shit, different year
> I'm curious if the general mood and vitriol on both sides was similar during previous crashes?

Yes, the general mood from reading forums is basically identical. Markets never change, the bear and bull market patterns are driven by emotions. This is true even outside of bitcoin with stuff like the stock market.

All these bears you see are mostly likely traders with short positions open. They make money when the price falls (until they close their position that is)

The only difference I see is that some of the emotional manipulation now happens on CNBC. Also there are more comments on this subreddit because it has more traffic/subscribers.
I was there when Bitcoin crashed from 100 down to almost nothing. That crash was nothing compared to the current one. At the time, Bitcoin was seen as a child's game. A Waste of time for geeks. Pennies were lost. In fact, the most people I saw ripping their hair out of their heads, were mining friends who told themselves they had lost the perfect moment to sell the hundreds of Coins they had mined in their bedrooms. They weren't actually concerned about losing their investment... they hadn't made any!

This latest crash is different by several orders of magnitude. People have actually lost large sums of investment. We are talking about investments in the order of thousands of dollars, if not millions. 

In the first crash, little to almost no one was actually investing any serious money. The Bitcoin daily volume was very very low. It was like losing your lunch money. 

In this last one, there were people who actually took loans and second mortgages to invest in Bitcoin. Insane!

Edited: improved writing. 
Before December, it was an investment that had never suffered a serious decline; after December, it is an investment that suffered a serious decline and there are a zillion folks who lost money on it. Night and day.
If you drink the poison, but some good stuff at least 
I thought buying bitcoin is the equivalent to obtaining money?


From selling in mainland yes, but I think the objective of these new Chinese exchanges is to sell abroad. Good way to suck the money from other markets. Nicely played.


No one knows.
$0
3k as a guess.  The tech will take some time to mature.  We are in another two year zone.  My LN wallet is ready to slug it out slowly.
Strictly from a TA perspective (if you believe in it) 

...... $5,221
1200 base support
I'm guess $2000 by end of 2018

$1000 by 2020

after that...

🤷‍♀️
Yes, definitely
Fuck trump 
As stupid as the folks who bought in north of 15000 feel now?
There are a lot of people who dont mine for current profit, but for future profit with a lot of money, so they can subsidize the current loses. Also you have 9 years history of possible unsold bitcoins when mining was much cheaper. So there can be very long time period with price under the mining price. Mining price at this moment means nothing. But ultimatly, this cant go on forever, someday this inevitably needs to switch to other side and comes the boom !
When people stop mining, the hashrate goes down. When this happens, difficulty adjusts until there's a new equilibrium and mining is profitable again.

It's quite ingenious. It means, mining will be profitable at nearly every price... in the long run.
That whole 51% thing is overblown. Media does this with pretty much everything crypto related because it makes them a fortune through ad clicks and views.
A lot of miners are in pools, so the hardware would not really be in that 51%. Now that being said, the block being mined is still chosen by the pool authority and protocol but there are new protocols being proposed and this stuff will constantly be improved and upgraded. Everyone really needs to understand how much improvement will be made to the entire Bitcoin network over the next 5-10 years and that's the time frame you need to consider, not this day to day fiat price bullshit. Bitcoin is  being woven into the fabric of our society and the haters and morons who comment without any understanding of what is going in the world are just noise.
The real question is how could it possibly be unprofitable when the price is still up hundreds of percent year over year.  

No one could have expected last year's rise.  Even with short term losses it should be a no brainier to mine.  Something very odd about it all. 
Quality fud lol
jinxed it ;)

edit: literally the moment you posted that [https://i.imgur.com/bn81gky.png](https://i.imgur.com/bn81gky.png)
Bottoms rarely give you a chance to buy and tops a chance to sell.

"Guys it's no big deal, I got some snacks"
Ok Mr Wunderbaah, the quilt guy. 
Where did you buy using LN?
Haha, all six people that used LN, saving him like a dollar ... come on man, do the maths.
the question is not how long, but if it's gonna happen
You could be right, but you’re also a fool not to consider or entertain this could be the story of something that provides no value to the world.

People continue to compare bitcoin to the internet. But it’s probably more comparable to the dotcom. A few people got rich of registering domain names, but it didn’t really sustain the test of time.
Do you realize the internet: one of the greatest human inventions to benefit the human species, was developed quicker. Meaning it scaled to allow more users. Bitcoin will go right back to $40 fees if price touches $12k. Nothing new to the technology. Lightning isn’t working per the articles and twitter feeds, if the amount is over $5. Trust is diminished. A Currency cannot exist without trust. 
Or the death of nothing more than a gigantic millennial-generation-powered illusion, much like the crashes in the eighties, powered by the yuppie generation hopes and dreams. 


Eventually all Ponzi Schemes make their final ATH and end at an ATL.
Months? You mean hours right? 
You guys are hilarious. 
End of next week.
or tonight

By September, my guess is that BTC will be trading within the previous consolidation range of roughly 4800-4600, which was 
formed over a period of 6 weeks in 2017 (from mid-August to early October).  Looks like we're finally down to the Siegfried Line.
You mean 5.5k might be the high for the upcoming months. We're on track to see 5.5k by breakfast. 
Always thought it was stupid how Bitcoin proponents said deflationary price increases won't hinder usage.
Which is all FUD. The fundamentals of bitcoin are as strong as ever.
I see you are really having fun.
lol what is this FUD for ants? Jesus after all we've been through over the years you say that with a straight face 🙄

Crypto experienced a bubble and it's correcting. Period. One year ago 1 BTC was 2500. The network is running better than during the bubble and in general the level of infrastructure and regulated platforms is a dream compared to what we had during other crashes.
I think you're wrong.

I actually cashed out a few days ago, but that doesn't mean I don't believe in the technology. I just don't believe in the current price. I *do* believe that it will go up in the long run. But I don't know when it will be, and I don't know how low it will go before it turns around.

So yes, I'd recommend to cash out for now.

But the technology is evolving, Lightning Network is just in its infancy. Bitcoin has proven again and again that it's secure. PoW and transaction fees generate a decentralized system that is nearly indestructable. 

It won't go away. No matter how low the price falls. Because when miners go out of business, the hashrate falls, difficulty adjusts... And mining stays profitable for the remaining miners. It's an ingenious concept!

The priceaction sucks. Many people are losing money. That's bad. But Bitcoin will stay. And someday it will be successful.

Just not right away.
Please sell so I can acquire more cheap. I hope it goes sub $1k again.. 
What is bitcon

Don't worry, bro.  I upvoted you
I think we will see a solid price run-up leading up to the conference and then steady growth the rest of the year. At these prices you're practically stealing bitcoin. Time to accumulate.
There was a time when people paid over $100,000 for a comic book. Oh wait they still do

There was a time people paid over $1,200 for an ounce of yellow metal. Oh wait they still do

There was a time that people argued that housing was going to become worthless and you should just rent. Then housing turned around for a 100% gain in a lot of American cities

The thing about bubbles is if you're actually in one people don't realize it. At least most people don't and that was December. By the time they finally realize it's a bubble which is what's going on in here now oftentimes you're right about at the low. That was the case and housing. The most extreme pessimism is when the deals were the absolute best. That was the case with tech stocks. If you would have bought practically any decent tech company in 2003 it was a ridiculously easy return. It's when everyone was terrified of anything with the word Tech

We are at the same situation with Bitcoin right now. Could It Go lower? Sure. In fact it might. But it hasn't happened yet and we are still sitting right on support. I have a really hard time finding bearish comments in December and a very easy time finding them right now. You guys are being emotional.
What's the tulip story?
I love how people compare bitcoin to beanie babies, not even realizing that there is still a thriving beanie baby market if you know where to look. It's not mainstream anymore, but swap meets, forums, etc. all have enough activity to make a nice living buying and selling beanies. Look up prices on Decade, Tabasco, Peanuts. Enough people snatched up these examples when the market plummeted in the late 90s that they are hard to find aside from a few beanie whales. 
There is really strong support at 6K. I'd love it to go down that far, but I'm not holding my breath.
Less if segwit and Lightning aren’t mandated by the users. 
The next hours are critical! (tm)
So?  Nothing happened?  Maybe this chicken blood reading is all BS!
I think we would need a good reason to go (significantly) up at this moment.. 



I see dead buyers


Edit:
Sad thing is that today's fundamentals are much better than 6 months ago. Now we have regulation, KYC, AML, no MtGox, ETFs are somewhere in a pipeline, etc.. 
but the market does need to honor it immediatelly.. and while saying this, hard to make such statement while knowing that btc as a commodity does not have any fundamentals..(price is determined exlusively by the market)


Edit 2:
I see on a few occasions that price level of 6050 was defended. Each time sellers/shorters tried to dump the price, it was quickly reverted.
I think (please correct me) that such strong defence is a good sign
Sideways I think for a while longer.

NOBODY knows. But if you wanna look smart you have a 50&#37; chance of being right! Personally I think people should be more concerned about accumulating, because one thing most agree on is that in the not so distant future, Bitcoin will almost certainly be a hell of a lot higher in price than it is now. When Bitcoin gets its legs there's going to be some serious disruption in how we finance and invest.
This looks like a sumo fight between bulls and bears..

Good strong support, but no bounce unfortunatelly
To up the ante you must wager something dickhead 
I'm a holder, and your posts just seem so pathologically optimistic and self assuring. It makes me sad and the apparent desperation in your posts probably drives people to sell. 
Much like the Phoenix, the impending bullrun is a myth. 
While anything is possible, next week is a bit ambitious lol. No worries though really, keep a 5 year time frame in mind with tech adoption and evolution. Bitcoin has gone from pennies to 6k in a decade and now only now are people really starting to pay attention. 
Read some in depth articles, listen to crypto podcasts, etc in the meantime. The more you learn about what's going on around the entire globe with bitcoin, and how much contribution is being made to the open source code of the network, the less you will worry about price. The day will come sooner than you even realize when the value of a single Bitcoin will be incredible.
"cheap", there is no definitive price for bitcoin. It can be 0 or 100k, its worth only as much people belive in it.
That was due to anticipation for blockchain week. Now there is no catalyst in sight. I've given up tbh
> the price for Bitcoin is, relatively, cheap.

Relative to what? Even with the drop from ATH, it's still way higher than it was a year ago.
5k next week boyo
Many people in this thread are too mental blocked, short sighted and caught up in the token price to use the brain power required to comprehend where this is all headed. But I do very much appreciate that you get it.
Yeah, but none of those things cause a zillion dollars only shortly after hearing about it, unless you want to include the dot-con crash in there.
Bitcoin isn't waiting on some technological breakthrough for it to be viable for the masses like your example of the internet or even the personal computer to add another.  It's currently ready for use and very few are using it for its intended purpose.
We all in for the tech!
You're delusional if you think Bitcoin has anywhere near the usefulness of the Internet. 

Actually, you're delusional if you think Bitcoin has much usefulness for the average person at all. 
So that's why the price has been skyrocketing! Thanks!

Time will show us who is correct but I get a big impression of Belfort just wanting to get his name in some headlines.
[deleted]
Call a plumber.
Actually, I think there will be at least run at 7000 before going solidly into 5000 territory -- that's just been the nature of the recent cycles. Remember a couple of weeks ago when it shot to around 8300 before sinking to where it is now? And before that, etc., etc.
Nah moon time bitch
All three of those stocks generated cash from operations and it was possible to establish some valuation basis on those cash flows.  No such valuation basis exists in this case. And it didn’t with tulips either. 
Or it could be [Pets.com](https://Pets.com) and 20,000 other failed "great ideas that will revolutionize the future!"
6k imminent! We're back in business!
Who are the bulls? Ive wondered for months, who the heck is buying? Everyone could see it was an historic bubble. Who is buying? Its like running to catch a train that is driving off a cliff in front of your eyes.
LN?
lmao you're a fucking idiot

I think we are going to see a pump soon.

Number of short positions grew by over 2,000 positions in last 24 hours.

Shorts rekk incoming.
july is historically low for bitcoin btw
Not unless some stories on "bad characters" hits the press -- so far, it is just a totally-faceless investment where a zillion folks lost literally billions of dollars. Need the "human interest" part of it to be a story, i.e., the guy laughing on his yacht while some single mom moves her kids into a box on the sidewalk.
So now that the cheaters have taken a break from extracting value from your portfolio you want people to hold what's left while they decide to do it again.

You see how insane that is right? If you really believe there is theft you should get the fuck out. Not hold. 

I truly feel for anyone who is long into BTC.  
when the investors are devs, it doesn't count.
Weve been hearing about this rally that is supposed to happen "any minute now" for the last 6 months...  When do you accept that it might not be coming?
Usually the market does not slowly bottom, right?

Yes, a couple more weeks of shaking down peoples hopes and dreams, scaring them and draggin them down the dirt until they give up all they have to the bigboys. hang in there and eat the dirt.
Remind me!
I think Clif High also predicted btc at 50k by some time this year.. right?

that's not going to happen. you honestly think people just get burned over and over and over and keep coming back? good luck out there.
Or not. The last run-up was before a zillion people got burned when it crashed from 19000. Very easy emotionally to invest in something that has never crashed before, not so easy when it has.
As a loyal member here, I have to. No eye contact tho
Public perception?! This is a crypto conference. Infrastructure still isn't there? It's been a decade and crypto enthusiasts still can't make crypto payment to a crypto conference?! 
Nope.
We are all just tryin to get rich :)
Lightning and segwit are being implemented conservatively for good reason but this generation won’t benefit from it. 
The problem is that for some kids, the future is next week lol. One thing that has rang true throughout history is the simple saying good thing come to those who are patient. Bitcoin is only now getting people's attention because of a price spike last December.
Mass adoption is almost inevitable.
Gets it.
This technology is important. We are not coders so don’t know the difficulty but 9 year development seems long to develop anything. Internet from 93 to 03. Same time frame. I know switching to a new currency or even just a store if value if that’s the aim, is difficult cause human beings work (give time of their lives) for the currency they exchange for goods and services.  
A lot of people gave it a chance and fees skyrocketed. This has to be grass roots before mainstream. Lightning per all information out there is not ready for prime time. At this rate, it will be the next generation willing to give bitcoin another chance but that maybe enough. I just wished I could live to see decentralization of banking. This pace of development......... I don’t know what to say. Everyone has theories but no one knows and anything you say is a guess. Maybe too many early holders to trust a currency owned by so few. Lightning would alleviate that mistrust allowing micropayments but segwit is only 40% adoption at best. Humans are not patient species. 
It has been 9 years already. How many do you think Bitcoin needs to be functional? 15?
Yeah good idea. Keep lambo for your side chick. 
Hint: Larry is the guy who hodled his bitcoin until the mass adoption event in 2020. He now owns a yacht, three lambos, a nice house, and donates to charity every year. Meanwhile, nocoiners can't even afford a PT Cruiser. 
Larry's dad didn't take investment strategies from memes and cashed out at 18k. 
If it hits 6k again I will cut off some of my hair. 
There he is 
oh... excuse me

its not BELOW 5800

its just $5845

what a relief!!!

😂😂😂
Nope.
You can’t seriously know about the future and roller coasters can you 
Good thing this isn’t a literal rollercoaster. 
....from the initial peak you mean. 
Going up from here. 230's - 250's absolutely the bottom. Knew prices were getting ridiculous. Just in time for the Pundi x airdrop baby. 
Already all in on Pundi X. Enjoying the 7.316 &#37; airdrops on Binance every month. Getting over 1 million shares a month currently. If this market ever turns around i'll be back where I was pretty quickly. 
Told you boys we'd bounce back today. We're at the bottom already. Everyone calling for Bitcoin to hit 5k, how often is everyone right. 
The halvening
Well sell it then.  You lose it when you sell
>And to wish death upon millions - you are a lunatic.  

Oh... no no no. I don't wish death on anyone. It's a natural side effect of humans being really shitty creatures. I truly hope we are better than that.

> Free?  Free of what?  The alternative to government is chaos.  

Yeah... unfortunately, government is only sustained by using violence against dissenters, which is unforgivable. Believe me, death is better than life under a gun. You are likely privileged enough to scoff at this. Good for you.

> Name me please one example of a truly free society in all of history that thrived and prospered.

In all of history there has never been a free society that did not collapse... including this one. You are living in the remains of a collapsed one today. But this is the nature of societies. Just as oppressed peoples rise up and destroy oppressive governments, the privileged don't understand the freedoms they have until they're gone.

>You think cryptos is the answer?  Well, think again where the price of BTC is being decided.  90&#37; of the trading is carried out on shady exchanges in China and if you think the price is truly market driven, then you are naive and stupid.

I'm not interested in namecalling or ad hominem attacks.

Yes, I think cryptocurrencies are a great step forward and a weapon for the people against a tyrannical government.

No, I am not concerned with the price manipulation. Price manipulation does not impact cryptocurrency's ability to evade taxation and censorship, literally starving the state slowly to death as it finds itself powerless to pay its enforcers.

Although I do not personally involve myself with illegal activity, I am very, very excited about the impunity cryptocurrency can provide to those who fight for freedom on all fronts.
Government's actually do a lot to stabilize dollar value.   Having no levers to pull could be disasterous.
100&#37; true, I certainly have no problems buying goods and services with my dollars and even get cash back on my credit card every year. People here take for granted having a police force, military, hospitals, etc. that are funded by tax dollars. 
Venezuela is the result of socialist policies - of mob rule and envy. You're an evil bastard to be brushing it aside as some "fiscal mismanagement".
I won't lie. I get excited on those runups too. It's inhuman not to. I've been through three or four of them now.

I just have no plans to buy extravagant shit. Not my bag.
>I am new to crypto and entered in January this year. 

Fucking *ouch*, my dude.

For what it's worth, I think it will go back up eventually. I think BTC has one more round in her.

After that though, start looking into other stuff. Bitcoin was the first but I am pretty sure it's far from the final word.

No shitcoins either. Bitcoin has been done already, no need to do it again. Stay away from ICOs. Go for the novel stuff. Read whitepapers and use your bullshit detector.

Best of luck.


*shrugs* I mean, if that's all you've got.

I'm over here rooting for your freedom to talk shit anonymously online. You know, the one the state wants to take away from you.
Lol!  I would say there are idiots in both camps.
It will not. 
don't fool yourself
Pick a percentage that you can live with, say 5&#37; (or whatever) from this point forward and commit.  

  
Then you still have the remainder to do with as you please.
Wish I was because I’d be rich now. 

I’ve read enough old posts from that time period to get a nice flavor for it.  Enough to know that nearly everything the bears, nocoiners, and fudsters say is bs designed to make you sell your coins.  Not fallin for it. 
It doesn't matter. if the only thing you care about is Fiat conversion you're not going to be around long. Most people can't handle the ride. You may notice the majority of comments in here are from accounts that are under 3 months old. If it goes to 5000 buy more.

I mean just looking at the shopping list of comments on your post history pretty much everything you're saying is bearish or confrontational. Head over to bitmex and short the market if you're so certain
Yes he was the latest to say this, I just added my 2 cents worth and why I agree.
Until we didn't. 
It won't make him rich, but it will come back to 15k this year or the next.
How can you buy bitcoin after suicide?
1900 wasn't even a year ago either.
No that's what governments/banks do now. Bitcoin will address that problem to a small extent in a decade or so.
No it doesn’t because there’s value in the underlying securities even if they’re overvalued right now. Go buy some water rights.
Not really. Stocks pays dividends to holders and directly correlates to real world assets which can be liquidated. You don't have to sell stock to get rich from it.
From less risky stocks to more risky bitcoin? People always put money in gold under mentioned circumstances. 
When investors get risk averse, they dump risky bets. That's why bitcoin went up so much in 2017 when risky sticks around the world were skyrocketing, and crashed in 2018 when investors rushed for safety. If we get a real bear market in stocks, bitcoin could drop back below $1k.
That's true, if people can see that. The problem is I'm not sure if they trust Bitcoin the way we do. There's been so much fud. 
>	Especially now that it is at bottom prices. It lines up perfectly!

Can't tell if satire...
Since when is sincere opinion and advice trolling? 
Think of these warnings as free money for you!  

Out of curiosity, how much money would have you saved by selling in December?  
Early investors taking profits is the smart move.

Late investors taking losses is not.  

You don't need to be a weatherman to know which way the wind blows.
No thanks - I don't gamble on this stuff.

That's kind of the point - its' a total gamble.
Indeed. Successful tech endeavors succeed fast, not over the course of decades.
Most people never heard of bitcoin until last year. In that short time there's been insane development. Exchanges went from barely existing to having to stop taking new signups.
I've worked in network security for years and let me tell you THE INTERNET STARTED IN THE 60s. It took a HELL of a lot longer than Bitcoin.
Just be careful with your funds. I was all in even wanted to farm hardcore and buy hardcore but...ugh... 
It be nice to be proven wrong trust me :/ 
Shit is just depressing. 
People are literally throwing their money away. Selling now is a waste but buying seems like a waste as well. The money will be left where it is but I have no idea where the faith comes from anymore. Crypto, in general, have been underperforming for a while despite the progress.
Haha, great experience. I hodl mostly because I'm too lazy to do anything. I am seeing and hearing a lot of "hodlers are the suckers left holding the bag, take some profits, the smart money has already left." I'm just curious if this has always been the sentiment during crash times.

I am 100&#37; positive though that if I had had 100 btc at $2-3 I would have sold at $9 like you, no question.

At least I'm glad to hear that the pain/crash ratio is about the same through the years.

I plan to continue being lazy. Could go to zero, could go to $1M, I'll be the last to know.
So you're saying....Invest in smart dust! That's my TA for the day.
That's freaky familiar language, interesting
>At the time, Bitcoin was seen as a child's game. A Waste of time for geeks.

I wish I could type with a polite tone of voice, but I cannot.  So all I can say, in a non-argumentative way... were you actually there?  Because I was sitting in the freenode IRC every day, and on the bitcoin forums, and even on this subreddit, and it felt very much every bit as real.  Regular people invested $20,000 then, and they invested $20,000 now.  It makes no difference how many btc it bought.  There was still a lot of money at play.

It very well may feel different if you were at a different time financially in your life.  If you were only 19 playing around with $500, then it is child's play.  And 6 years later, it can feel like the real deal at magnitudes larger.  But it is just perspective.

That is simply my take on it, I'm not downvoting or arguing, like I said I wish I could say this with a polite tone, I don't want to come off wrong.  But there were just so many people invested then.  Even a $1000 bitcoin required a huge market cap back then.
Good insight, I guess that's one strange part about investing in bitcoin. When people see the price at 3K, 4K, 10K, it strangely drives their idea for how much money they should invest, like "What's the point of investing if I don't own full bitcoins?"

I will admit that during the run from like 10K to 13K I was thinking, "well, better mortgage the house." laziness prevailed.

While I'm glad that I'm not in that position I do feel bad for people that put in everything when it was at 19K. Like you said that's life-changing money and in previous crashes that wasn't the case.
What are you talking about?  It has suffered numerous serious declines in the past, way before last December.
I do not believe it's possible for a dozen of these exchanges to spring from nowhere with each having twice the trade volume of GDAX.

It will not be a surprise if we trace the origins and it all leads back to Bitfinex/Tether.
Amen
Lol, so original
But don't actually fuck him, that would be Gross.

#shudder

You forgot to add President lol
More or less. The difference is that people who bought at 15k will feel good again eventually.
From what I understand, bitcoin adjusts difficulty every 2 weeks, a massive drop in hashrate would slow down the networks as it is harder to find blocks. Not sure what it means for transaction fees(up or down).Until thr next difficulty adjustment.
No further questions your honor
Damn.  Now I wish it's regulated so that we can freeze trading.
I don't know who that is, but there are several quilt shops in my state that accept lightning network. I guess word spreads. 
A gas station outside of Crystal Lake, Iowa
As I was chatting to the owner six other people behind me paid for their purchases using LN. This was in a window of probably 10 minutes. By the way, not a single one of them had any issues finding a path to the gas stations node. 
Yes.
Blockchain isn't going anywhere, Bitcoin on the other hand I am not so sure. 
Why wouldn't it happen?  Its an amazing technological invention that has the power to change the world.  Its potential has barely been realized.  What could possibly disrupt it?
Bitcoin will go through far more rises and drops and will very likely outlive us all. Over years not weeks or months. You're analogy is not accurate...blockchain is comparable to the dot com. Many companies added blockchain to their name and got temporary lifts in their stock price. Most blockchain projects are nothing more than white papers with no implementation. Only purpose was to generate profit from token sales. Bitcoin will be the Amazon of the blockchain era.
it provides a ton of value.  You can be your own bank.  
How long have you been researching Bitcoin?  
such as World peace?  There's no money in that, but there is plenty of money to be made in crypto.  Its the birth of a new asset class.  Tons of money in getting 1-5% of ppl's 401k's exposure.
It's not a Ponzi.  But yes, it's a speculative asset - high risk/high returns.
and then what?  It just dies and all the ppl working in this industry go to work for Facebook, Apple Google etc.?  Crypto is a new asset class and Wall street is embracing it.  They want to SELL things to ppl and all of their clients want exposure.  And most Americans with 401k's will have no prob putting in a small percentage of their retirement into it.  Its a no brainer
No. They're realistic. 
or over the weekend
It hinders excessive consumption of useless bullshit, not consumption in the general case.

Think a little harder, for all of us, please.

Well then invest in Pundi X, you get .736&#37; airdrops every month which is ridiculous. Even when it goes down you gain. 
>Repeating a lie over and over and over does make it true.

And repeating this mantra does not make his opinion a lie.  
Been quite easy to short actually. Free money, thank you for HODLing!
Lol
There are some people that trade their labor for paper printed from thin air. 
Nice retort.
It's very easy to google
If there is really strong support at 6k, why is it at $5800?
"...really strong support at 6K (?)."
Today, BTC cut through 6K, like a hot knife through butter.
That was the mid-point of a 250 point intraday plunge.  Slipped through "support" like it was riding on astro-glide.
Just like the strong support everyone mentioned at 7K and 8K etc. 

Can’t wait for the 5K support comments
Hodling your breath?
Something did happen, it's just barely fighting 6k now. Pretty decisive move
I don’t like to gamble 
I bet Macaffee’s penis
You may perceive it as desperation, while others might understand it as a helping hand to the ignorant.
Honestly man...  I laughed and I like this guy 
Its all or nothing. We fight with global money supply made of thin air which is destined to fail at some point. We cant lose
[deleted]
So if people said its worth 20k and is a 6k now I would call that cheap.
That means nothing to people who didn't buy a year ago
Unlikely - but it doesn't matter.  Only to shorters.
That's simply because none of those things had the internet to fast track them. Bitcoin is a global currency digitally stored and if you think it's even CLOSE to going away I'm not sure there's not anything else that can be said until you stop forming an opinion without any real world knowledge. Name 5 countries that are implementing it, name 5 decentralized exchanges and give a short explanation of each one's model, and listen to a handful of interviews from people like Jimmy Song (Bitcoin developer). That's nothing but at least then you may have had to learn enough to see what's going on globally.
Ready to use? It's not even out of its crib naps yet. You guys need to go read. Have you asked an average Joe to try and buy bitcoin and store it on a cold wallet? Yes, that's cake for us, but that's not user friendliness!!!! That's why the net took so long to come to homes and businesses. Bitcoin needs MULTIPLE players of user friendly upgrades before it's even near mainstream use. Seriously, wtf do you guys get your information???
Bitcoin needs some massive technological breakthroughs to be usable. Fees shoot up to $50 whenever transaction rates reach a fraction of a percent of a major credit card. It uses hundreds of thousands of times more energy per transaction than any other financial system. Solving either of those problems will require technology that currently does not exist. Once that happens, bitcoin could become a real payment system that works at scale. I don't think it would become popular, but it would at least become possible.
Let me go ask the average Venezuelans how their govt money is helping them so far the past year...
5979
he's also the reason you guys use the term DCA.... you know how much this guy made off people with that scheme?
I like it when I'm right. 
The whole notion of comparing Bitcoin to stocks or gold is absurd. Bitcoin has artificial scarcity, no intrinsic value and generates no profit. Bitcoin is digital beanie babies and nothing more. 
well, those stocks were also generating Negative numbers of cash from operations in certain period.

when considering the values of software business or internet service business, it really depend on the usage case , but the value is not always(most of time it's not) connect to their stock price.  there are also demand aspect, think about diamond, it's worth nothing until people wants it because some dude promote it properly , if you just consider physical value of natural diamond to man-made diamond, there is really not much difference, but the price difference is so big. 

All that I'm saying is that it's not that simple trying to judge value of certain things, don't just look at chart, says it's bubble (or not). or just because you can or cannot hold it in you hand.


You funny man :)
This train has run off a cliff many times, the last time it fell 80% it made rich anyone that caught it. History of course might not repeat again but it's easy to understand why people are buying. This shit is a violent asset and every bubble crash overextends itself so trying to catch that bottom is just good risk/reward for many.
Not exactly what your wife hawt mama told me after the blowjob
Takes an idiot to know another of its own kind.
Love you too brother

Even that happens, it will be a small and short pump, and then followed by a huugge dump.
Longs are way higher than shorts at the moment (33k+ compared to 24k+). There's far more chance of a long squeeze at the moment and its result would be far more violent than a short squeeze at the current level.

The trend of this market is still heavily bearish. If there's a pump, traders will reload their shorts and get ready to have a third stab at $5.8k support. The odds are overwhelmingly stacked towards further drops.
Or traders see the only way to make money from bitcoin now is going short as a major "support" level is breached with no other "support" for another what 80&#37; drop from here? (p.s. i dont actually believe there is such a thing as support levels for bitcoin)
You do? Ha ha ha, that's hilarious. You go ahead and feel bad, and stay inside your own world. Hope it's OK if a few of us grab some of this cheap Bitcoin though because although it may or may not drop a tad further, the long run looks pretty G damn prosperous. 
But hey, who cares what I think I know right? 

Any minute now. **MASS ADOPTION** Right around the corner. Buy more Bitcoin! 
Is this a slow bottom? In comparison to decreasing, we haven’t increased much at all in quite some time.  It’s been a straight decline since we did not break 10k. 
Although some of those are closing out short positions . . . . .
Troll on trollbrother dude 
> hang in there and eat the dirt.

Thank sir, may I have another dirt sandwich?
That’s exactly how it is to. Almost everybody in the sector of finance believes we’re at or near the bottom. Their shaking out the last of the weak hands throughout the summer. It said also their will be a new era of crypto millionaires made by the end of the year for those that “ believed” and held true to their beliefs whatever that meant lol. 
Yes he predicted 40 k  by July is it July yet?.. no 
Then what are you doing in a bitcoin reddit. if you’re just here to dog and spread false information and talk about how bad we’re going to lose in bitcoin why the hell are you in this forum then. Do you guys just like come in here starting fights and drama because that’s what it seems like if you’re not an investor of this technology and then what are you doing here
>you honestly think people just get burned over and over and over and keep coming back? 

Yes, that's just the basic nature of addicted gamblers. Crytocurrency is just pump and dump, pump and dump, over and over again. There are always plenty of bag holders that rush in to buy at the top of every pump no matter how many times they get burned by the dumps.
Well let’s just hope for the best then another good run up we’re on the same team. But also you got a remember that 98% of the world is not even invested yet last year is a bunch a little kids on the Internet getting in you got a remember that barely anybody even knows about this stuff yet in the world is invested in it and the big money is definitely not in this stuff over
And again you’re one of the multi millions of people that forget 98% of the world hasn’t even touched or heard about crypto currency let alone got invested so there’s going to be Wave after wave after wave of new investors what you saw last year was not even the tip of the iceberg look at it like a baseball game we haven’t even thrown The first pitch yet
I remember the first access to internet. Seemed like quite a hassle, tying up the phone line, dialing up sometimes multiple times to connect, and then waiting for ages to download anything of any size, etc. It took years and years to get DSL and then finally fiber and we are not near where we will be in another decade.
You get my point. Wallet address translation, functioning layers on the network, easier purchasing and storage, and much more will happen over the next few years.
You said Bitcoin has been around a decade right? Well that's the foundation that gives faith to build on. But remember until last year, most people didn't even know what Bitcoin was! Just wait and see what happens in the next few years. Bitcoin will get legs and walk, eventually run and shit will get real.
Computer Engineer <----- me

The first-ever computer-to-computer link was established on ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network), the precursor to the Internet, on October 29, 1969

So 23 years before the start of mass adoption in 1992
It depends on how many roadblocks it encounters along the way. They blew up a lot of rockets trying to put man in space and they were pushing progress hard on the wire.
The decade of stable uptime and no compromised transactions are far more powerful of a narrative than speed and fees. Long as there's a stable foundation to build on the rest will happen.
Singular? If we are going to the m00n, I deserve at least two side chicks for my great heroic feat of holding a deflationary asset. 
DAE nocoiners are gonna be poor LOL

God some people are sad. You realise these people are just skeptical and/or fearful about a world run by people like *you*?

Me too.

That's not the figure I'm seeing... I'm seeing $5940.
Halvening means a deceleration of new BTC supply. What if the deceleration of demand is greater?
My friend, if cryptos ever even come near to become a threat to governments or the world financial system, what do you think will happen?

It is very simple for governments to pass laws that will make it illegal to trade with cryptos.  Morocco is one place that has done that.  Sure, it's hard to crack down on a decentralised system but they don't need to do that.  They just have to crack down on the merchants and impose heavy fines/jail if they accept cryptos.  If you can't buy/sell using cryptos, then it's as good as dead.
See, the levers are pulled at the cost of your liberties though. It's fine if you voluntarily give them up, but I refuse. 

*Molon labe.*
Unfortunately, those things are all funded by stealing from citizens. 

I would gladly support hospitals voluntarily. The other things not so much.
My bad.

So BTC is going to solve the results of socialist policies?  
I got excited too, as I am hoping to end this bear market, not to get me wrong
See, took me only 6 months to spot people like you. 
Correct. 
sorry I don't understand what that means. Realizing in this context is if he cashed out. If his losses are unrealized (not sold) then he hasn't lost anything until he cashes out. 
Yeah I've been on that plan for some time now, definitely a great way to proceed!  
I do see a lot of parallels from what forums I've read myself
if it goes to 5000 buy more, then when it goes to 4000 buy more, then when it goes to 3000 buy more, soon when it dies for good you will have all the wonderful chucky cheese tokens online you want
Elevator floor. The door opens and closes a few times at each floor before going down to the next one.
This is exactly my point.  You're stating long shot gambles as facts.

I actually thought he meant he would sell.
I don't see the point of you clowns repeating that something which isn't an asset isn't asset. Bitcoin isn't an asset. Never was. Go home you are boring.
He is saying it sounds like the stock market because OP diluted the definition of a Ponzi Scheme so that it is applicable to nearly any investment strategy.
"uncorrelated assets"
There has, and the fact that Bitcoin continues on is a great signal of it's robustness. The power of a global currency is incredible and before long many of the possibilities for application and benefit of Bitcoin will be realized. You see signals that your country's currency is going to drop in value soon ..move it to a global hedge and retain that value. Or in the case of Bitcoin, potentially increase that value since Bitcoin has most likely taken the heavy hits and changing direction very soon. Remember, most people didn't even know what Bitcoin was a year ago. The awareness stage is only now upon us. Can you even imagine 5 years from now??
That does not surprise me.
When you start a post with The Greater Fool, it's quite obvious that you are just here to gloat and troll.

Anyway, take it as friendly advice - karma is a thing.
Buy low sell high. How much money will you make if you buy today?
They only take losses if they sell because they didn't take a look around the world to see what's happening with Bitcoin.
You don't need to be a weatherman to know which way the wind blows but you need to be a meteorologist to understand why there's a storm coming.
Weathermen don't know shit anyway, they just read the screen sort of like what you're doing to get your Bitcoin information.
AOL 1995-2003. Developed basically to what we have today. Internet is a platform and easier. Bitcoin is a currency and/or store of value. That takes trust which is not available among this current marketplace. I thought the technology could handle adoption but we were all proven wrong in December. 
agree

"ugh" is right!

This is exactly what a bear market is. You might be right, but based on past performance (which I know doesn't prove anything,  but it's the best we have), things will turn around. Will BTC ever moon again? I dont know, but I highly doubt this is the new ATH. Just hold on to it and go about your life. Pretend like the money is gone and put some money in index funds for a while. Don't panic sell. I think you're likely to regret it if you do. 
Atleast you can say your in iT for the tech
Yup.  They are trying to manipulate us into thinking that somehow this time is different.  It's all b.s.

We are basically the equivalent of the hodlers from 2014.   Hmm let's see, price was around $200 at low point in 2014, and those who were patient saw almost 100x gains from the low by Dec. 2017.

We are the hodlers now in 2018.  Let's say we have some patience and hold for a few years, maybe we'll see 100x gains by then too.
Desire to look up crash-era r/Bitcoin posts intensifies
> were you actually there?

Yes I was. I may have not taken part in every Bitcoin meeting at FreeNode, but I was surely keeping track of what was going on.

> Regular people invested $20,000

I honestly never personally knew anyone who invested 20K in 2010 or 2011. In my group of friends who were mining, we never put one single cent into it. We mined everything. 

One of my friends developed a serious depression, because people in his group of friends, convinced him that Bitcoin was a stupid idea and a waste of energy, to have his computer always turned on to mine. I remember perfectly when I told him that Bitcoin had reached 100$. He completely forgot about it and then blamed himself for having listen to his other friends. I told me that he had sold around 80% of the Bitcoins he had mined (around 2K BTC) at around 20$. A few weeks later, I can't recall exactly when, he was at home with a serious depression and a medical leave. Not because he had lost money, but because he could have earned a lot more.

> That is simply my take on it, I'm not downvoting or arguing, like I said I wish I could say this with a polite tone

No worries. I understand your point of view. I respect it. 


Nowhere even CLOSE to the carnage of December in terms of billions lost.
Same snowflake same
I don’t live in your shit country, so no. Your putin puppet leader is your biggest mistake. 
More like czar
Doubt it, since the vast majority took their losses and sold, probably never to buy crypto again having been severely burned on it once already. On the other hand, the markets are made of recidivist suckers.
Nothing says mass adoption like a few quilt shops in Iowa.
So, you paid for gas using LN? 

I thought it is still in beta
I live close to Crystal lake, Iowa. Would you mind telling me which gas station? 
<disbelieve> 
That's a pretty tall tail my friend. Not that I want to indulge you making things up on the internet (because who would do that), but let's do the maths on what this made up merchant is actually saving in transaction fees.

Typically a merchant will pay half a percent using Visa or Mastercard (usually they'll charge a 1&#37;-1.5&#37; fee on using a card so they actually make money on you using a card, but let's forget that). Average convenience stores do 3.5M in revenue each year (per [http://smallbusiness.chron.com/average-gross-revenue-convenience-store-35712.html](http://smallbusiness.chron.com/average-gross-revenue-convenience-store-35712.html)). That seems a bit high for Crystal Lake, Iowa, so let's assume a cool 2M in annual revenue.

Let's also assume that Iowa sports the highest population of bitcoin users in the word with 1 in 10 people paying using LN. At most this merchant has saved $2M x 10&#37; x 0.5&#37;  ... over a whole year: a whopping $1000.

Why would any merchant risk bitcoin's instability (LN still in beta, bitcoin down 15&#37; this month, 51&#37; the past six months) to save $1000?

We get it - you're excited about bitcoin and LN - but when you talk shit and spread stupid lies it makes the whole community look like ridiculous fanboys.
Other way around
Amazing inventions always get replaced by even more amazing inventions.
Or you know...it won’t be. I thought blackberry would live forever. I thought Garmins would moon. AOL was the future. Skype would always be on top.

BTC and cryptos in general is a volatile, high risk/high return asset.  

It has no place in 401k, which is a retirement fund and provides the social security for our retirees.  I frankly cannot imagine the stress it will put retirees through if their retirement funds were to have dropped 70&#37; in months.

While I can understand your wanting the price of BTC to appreciate, please do so responsibly and thoughtfully instead of spouting such nonsense.
I can’t wait 
>Economies are driven by investment. Why invest in anything if you think your currency is going to have better returns. That is unless you want to live in a primitive society where people only spend their bitcoin on bread and water.
It brings down spending a notch, which brings down production a notch, which brings down the economy a notch, which in the long run brings up prices a notch, which brings down spending a notch, which......

Deflation's not a good thing yo.
I wasn't referring to blockchain, but to Bitcoin.


You mean like Bitconnect?
you are a retard, lol
Prove it.
Imagine that. I think Bitcoin might be one of the biggest psychological experiments that we have had in quite a long time. 

I'm literally floored by the amount of emotion in this sub
"Support" doesn't mean it never drops a dollar bellow it. It means around that level there's a lot of people who are buyers. In order to break support it needs to drop significantly below that level for an extended period of time. It's touched $5800 several times already.

None of this means support will hold in the long run, but the support exists.
Might want to leave this subreddit then
I'm just saying. I like a lot of your posts 
The demand could easily be 0. That's all that matters.
Let me guess you bought bitcoin X years ago and you are still up 6353232&#37; percent ? 
Oh, Bitcoin isn't going away just yet, but whether it is worth $50 in five years is the real question.
Oh, it will not go away. Whether it will be worth $500 this time next year is the real question.
Fudders don't read
Payment system? No sir. Store of value is the next bus stop for Bitcoin. Payment system is technologically years away. 
Currency devaluation/inflation is the consequence of poor fiscal governance, not the cause of it.  

Where Venezuela is concerned, BTC is not going to solve their problems.
Just because a country is economically shit doesn't mean Bitcoin is their salvation.

Just because Venezuelans are jumping to Bitcoin doesn't mean it has any use for people in the stable, developed world.


going back to 6k i bet lol
Gold has NOTHING on bitcoin. Just wait until the next generation are mainstream investors. Raised on digital, you think they'll choose clunks of metal dug up from the ground with no calculated supply cap? Time fixes stupid.
You're not exactly helping your case there chief. 
I remember 3rd grade.
Do you know what decentralised means? It has nothing to do with people holding huge amounts. And noone has 50%
Right. That's to rekt the shorters after the first drop.
You are right ... 
Put it this way - the best way for the exchanges to make real money is to rekt the leveraged Longs and Shorts.

And if you believe (as I do) that the exchanges are responsible for the price manipulation, then this scenario makes sense.
I wish you the best.  
We're the trolls...  How about you go convince more people to throw their life-savings down the drain?
>Almost everybody in the sector of finance believes we’re at or near the bottom

No, most people in finance still think buying bitcoin is a terrible idea, and many think the price will eventually drop to near zero. The bubble had only just begun to pop.
too, there...... please stop, your posts are bad for bitcoin.
you typed that out. lol.
Nah, I just want it to claw its way back to 6800 or so to create an opportunity to short it.
Riiiight. And a thunderstorm will come that will rain gold coins down on everybody! Valhalla!
Except none of those things caused investors to lose billions within just a couple of years, unless you want to count the dot-cons in that group.
Military application you are referencing. I am talking civilian. 
Depends how many btc do u hold. 

10 BTC= 1 side chick. 
What you don't realize is a person without bitcoin has no global reach. He can't truly participate in the global markets. Bitcoin is like applying for your passport for the very first time. His whole world opens up and he realizes just how sheltered his life was.
yes

its bouncing around a bit, as it crashes

it was almost 8000 at the beginning of this month (and June isn't even over) and now its under 6000

+25% drop this month

and we've been dropping every month this year

soon it'll be next to nothing if this keeps up!
Don't hit him with such smart questions. He might start crying in his bedroom.
That's why it's important to use these early times to our advantage. Now is the time to get the "old guard" invested heavily enough to create a strong interest for governments not to ban crypto even though it would be in their long term best interest.

If you have doubts about this, check out what the all-powerful governments are doing about climate change. :P that's right; nothing... because it turns out there is a lot of money tied up in ruining the world for everyone.

I believe we are already there to a degree. Banning crypto is a dangerous game. It's a race into a new industry and a government has two choices: 1) ban/regulate it and stifle innovation on their own soil, giving other nations the win, or 2) deal with it for now and get violent when the time comes.

Naturally I am hoping for 2, and when it comes time for the endgame, the armies simply have no account to draw their paychecks from.
Sure, there's a cost and benefit.
Even thought certain cops can be dicks, I would rather have a military/police force as opposed to utter lawlessness like the plot of 'The Purge'. I can't imagine any rational person wanting that. 
Anyone who thinks bitcoin/blockchain/crypto is going to solve the issues of failing economies is a moron. I would not mind having satoshis in my phone wallet and paying instantly for everything I buy but until that happens bitcoin is a pyramid scheme. We all are waiting for newbies to fall into this hole and stand onto their shoulders to get out/take profits.

Good. So then there’s no need to worry 
Why are you here? To save all the poor souls from getting rekt? Or to make yourself feel better?
You are claiming long shot odds that defy reason and real world event.

Educate me. Bitcoin is legal tender, which is an asset. What part am I missing?
It's a term of art dude.

I work with tech every day, hell my whole life is tech. AOL is a company that profited from helping to deliver the internet and make it accessible. I guess if you had to make an analogy, you could say AOL was to internet as Exchanges are to Bitcoin. The internet started in the 60s and most people never even heard of it until years and years later. Bitcoin is very much like it. Ask anyone who contributes code to the core. 

And seriously man, like no disrespect but you gotta stop saying it failed because it didn't deliver in December or whatever. I mean that was less than a year ago. You can believe me or not but that kind of progress takes a long time. Code needs to be reviewed under open source protocol and then tested under load. It takes many attempts and even non open source like Microsoft and Apple take multiple attempts many times.

Holy shit you came back an hour later to comment a second time and I see you calling other people snowflake 😂😂😂
Well, not those obviously, I mean those who listened to good advice and held.
Ha.. but in a way it might be an indicator.
I know you're being sarcastic, but I agree with you. When quilt shops (who cater mostly to the elderly) proudly advertise payments accepted via lightning network, you know that we're there. People need to realize that LN isn't some far off fantasy. It's here. It's now. And if people would just open their eyes, they would realize that it's changing the world. 
Nope it's live and fully functional. I didn't buy gas, but I did buy some skittles and a mountain dew!
Sure, I forget the name but it's close to the statue of the giant fish. If you're a local you should know where I mean.
That makes no sense.
These are not good comparisons. AOL would be more comparable to an Exchange, and the others are products. Nothing really compares because Bitcoin is a new entity as both a currency AND an investment.
It was a retorical question I think. Since based on what you say you seem to lack a lot of knowledge.
maybe i wasn't clear, I'm only talking 1-5% of their funds.  
For the realization to hit you too?  Based on your other posts,  it's not going to be fun.
Deflation kills economies as all economic activities crawl to a standstill.

The only effective instrument is quantitative easing, which is not possible using a currency that is, by design, limited in quantity.  Whoever thinks BTC is a good replacement for fiat needs to go back for Econ classes.
This guy gets it!
no u
I don’t have any emotion. I’ve seen all of this before. I just like to watch and read. The exact same story is playing out this time that did in 2014, there’s just more people involved this time. And there will be many more the next time. 
Someone.  Finally. 
I’m glad you like my posts, but unfortunately you do not seem to be learning much from them.  Please pay attention
Token price ... that's all you focus on then you have no focus.
It can't be a store of value until it can do something that provides value. If bitcoin can become a payment system, then it will have value, which means you can hold it as a store of value.
Ask USA how they get by by their used cars on loan, houses on loan and working 100km from home and be dependand on food stamps and gas prices
Gold is used for everything from wedding rings to a material coating and is in constant industrial demand. Bitcoin?
Yes. Yes they will.
We are going off topic I want to know about G20 regulations next month
Thank you, as do I you. Mature debate without the name calling is a good thing regardless of our differing opinions.
Those are called Shills homeslicedude
Remind me when 💯 
No I think your big mouth is bad for bitcoin what makes you any better then the rest of us 
Damn right m I’ll do it again when tour mom tells me to 
That’s rediculious see it’s people like you that prevent it from ever getting back to an all time high shorting it good luck getting burned one day a fool and his dollars soon parted 98% traders get burned have fun when the iron hits ur ass. Sit here and talk shit about bitcoin all day long we’re all tired of hearing it man go somewhere else for that nonsense we’re trying to see this thing grow in value not keep dogging on it
Going to be funny watching bitcoin hit $100,000 in 2019 just like the Winklevoss twins said and see you in the soup line thinking your Goldman Sachs when really you should have been holding what a fool just quit talking for I put the iron on you for real nigga 
You are referencing the day one guy (Satoshi) mined the first bitcoin when only a handful of people even knew about it. I am referencing the first computer network. Same same.

User group is irrelevant. If you want to go in the that direction then we are still in early adopter days like the military were the first adopters of computer networks. Most people never heard of bitcoin until last christmas. Most still have no bitcoin.
Damn. This Kool-Aid tastes like horse shit :(

Check my history. I'm a crypto fanatic and a libertarian anarchist wackadoo and I think you're being silly.

Ok, but it's not been as low as you are pretending, the first or the second time, at all today.

It's dropped around 3 points today. Not good, but you don't need to pretend it is 5 points.
Alright, very funny.
Most major governments have to interest in having bitcoin takeover their fiat currencies, whether it be Dollars, Yuan, Yen, Pesos, Rupees, etc and most citizens don't care as long as they can buy goods and services, which seems to be the case in most of the world except Venezuela.
>I can't imagine any rational person wanting that. 

Listen, maybe I'm not rational, but I do truly have our best interests at heart. I want to end state-sponsored suffering. Do you know how much pain police cause to innocent civilians?

Everyone fears the police. You don't have to be a libertarian or an anarchist to shit your pants when they pull up behind you. On top of that, the bias in the court sysyem ensures that they could literally ruin your day for fun on nothing but planted evidence and "the officer's word."

Sure sometimes bad things happen and the cops show up. Good for them. They cause a hell of a lot more suffering, though.

You sure they coming?  It's taking too long.
to say "I told you so" in a few months mostly
I know precisely what it is.

All I'm saying is that it's bad taste for you to be saying it now.  It's probably more acceptable when prices are high and such warnings are fair game.
Military application of the internet. Not civilian. 

And I mean no disrespect to bitcoin devs. They are best of the best and dealing with the hardest problem of trust. Its almost an impossible job and they brought it this far which is amazing. We couldn’t get over the fees/scalability.  Maybe mandate segwit would have helped but who knows at this point. 
Thanks finance expert from the future
I see you’ve accurately assessed a thing that happened. Good job sweetie. 
Sorry it was too tempting. The issue I see which made me more or less lose interest in this space is the fact that most people see bitcoin as an investment, which hinders mass adoption. I would never trade my MU shares for goods because I think it's going to go up substantially in value withing the next two years and the mindset for bitcoin is no different. 
So let's look at it this way... In the last week, your coin has lost $850. worth of Skittles and Mountain Dew in Iowa.
Is there any limit to how much you can spend? (I am in Europe)
Is it widely adopted?
Sheri's Southside store? 
Good thing I wasn’t comparing them. 
For pete's sake - these are retirees and most of them rely on this money to live out the rest of their lives, which may be another 30-40 years after retirement.

Stop being a douchebag.  You are the type that gives BTC investors a bad name.
Nah, true believers just move on to the next thing to true believe in. I'd wager that quite a few of the folks here also own Iraqi dinars which once upon a time were going to make them fabulously wealthy once the Iraqi government revalued (RV'd) them.
> a currency that is, by design, limited in quantity.

Keep storing your value in a currency that is, by design, unlimited in quantity lol and good luck.
I wasn't around for that one but I have been studying the 2014 time period pretty extensively for the past few months. The one thing I'll ask your opinion on is what you think of the price action? On the one hand the fundamental situation in 2014 was considerably worse than this one. There are also more people in the market now which historically makes markets less volatile. I really can't figure out if this thing is going to drag on until the next halving or if we are just going to continually cycle off support and have kind of a flat sideways market for awhile and or potentially leg down. Seems like historically when you get 70% off the high the bottom isn't far away. The psychology though. Oh my God I feel like I'm reading the same posts that I found from 2014. It's the same emotions just with different usernames
Stupid money stuff!
The closest Bitcoin can come to a payment system is an alternative system that runs along side fiat.  It will take generations to see Bitcoin replace fiat.

A store of value makes perfect sense. The value is in the incredible stability of the network, Not one single compromised transaction in it's 10 year run. Sounds like a hell of a safe place to store value and worth if you ask me. Can banks say that? The hardware and electricity used to mine and secure the transaction hold plenty of value.  What about when the next generation of digitally savvy investors come online?  
You can't compare Bitcoin to any other investment or currency, because it is both.
Actually, only 10&#37; is used in industry and that demand is not what drives the price of gold.

Gold is valuable simply because people thinks it is, is willing to pay for it for thousands of years and as a consequence, governments hold them in reserves as a hedge for their own currency.
Try to buy gold ring and then resell it back. Lets see what value it have
No, no they won't. Read up on the history of gold...the full history. Now cross reference that generation to the upcoming digital savvy generation, including what they value and prioritize.

More likely 2019 will be the year that I again tip you $5 for the nice work you did vacuuming out my car.
He's probably not old enough to own a credit card.
you can argue about how its dropped 3 or 5 points today

i'm more focused on the big picture, like how it went from about 20K in december 2017 to below 6K in June 2018

thats a HUGE loss of value

You think many new investors will come into something thats last 70% of its value in the last 6 months? 
?
It's funny how people talk about Venezuela as an exception. 

Venezuela is a forerunner. An example of things to come. I've got an idea... let's do some more quantitative easing!
 The road to hell is paved with good intentions.
If we follow human nature they will come
Fair enough :-)
Uh. . .prices are still high.

Feel warned?
Thanks, snowflake.  Feel free to have the last word as I know typical libs do.  😂

One of bitcoins greatest strength is that it isn't an income producing asset. It gains value because of it's intrinsic properties (decentralized, trustless, immutable, etc.). Therefore, it operates in a hybrid state where it's both an excellent currency and also an appreciating asset. When you look at it this way, it's actually very beneficial to spend it.
It only loses value if you sell. #HodlCrew.
There is no limit - People have transferred hundreds of thousands of dollars for a single satoshi. We're still in the early days, but in my town we have at least 10-15 stores that accept it. 
No that doesn't sound familiar. 
Im only advocating a super small allocation to crypto such as 1-5%.    And what about what happened in 2008?
Who the heck keeps anything in cash other than a small amount for convenience reasons?
But it‘s not actually unlimited because we have monetary policies that determine exactly what amount of money is currently needed in order to have the best conditions for our economy to run. BTC wouldn‘t have that. BTC would just lead to horrible deflation and complete collapse.
One side of me thinks the chart will ultimately look the same, the other side of me thinks a recovery could happen faster because there are more people involved and everything moves faster when more people and more money moves the market. I think about the halvening and I know that will probably price itself in months before the actual event. I know a lot of people have emotions and want to think that December was the ath and bitcoin will now have its slow demise, but they thought the same thing every time it had an ath and bleed off. Ultimately the fundamentals of the technology get better every day, and people need to realize even with that big run last year, still less than 1% of the world was involved. Next run 3% might be involved. What if 5% are involved? Then 12%. I still think we are 12-15 years away from mainstream adoption and actually stable prices. 
exactly this and most ppl don't get it
I'm a big supporter of BTC and I wish we will stop this nonsense about it being a safe store of value.

There is nothing "safe" about the value of an asset when it can go up 10x in a year and drop 70&#37; over 6 months.

Let's stop this nonsense as we all know it's baloney.  If we keep saying such idiotic things, it will just end up killing BTC's credibility.
>The closest Bitcoin can come to a payment system is an alternative system that runs along side fiat

Yes, that is what was promised, a new form of peer to peer cash. I don't think it will ever happen, but there could be some major technological advances over the next decade or so that make it possible. If that happens, the current prices are perhaps justified.

>The value is in the incredible stability of the network, Not one single compromised transaction in it's 10 year run.

It doesn't have the capacity to do enough transactions to go beyond a tiny niche group of users. It had some value for drug dealers years ago, but has now been replaced by better performing cryptocurrencies.

>Sounds like a hell of a safe place to store value

It lost 70% of it's value in a couple months. In what possible universe is that a safe store of value?

>Can banks say that?

Banks are a million times safer than bitcoin. In the last few months, tons of people have lost everything when exchanges get hacked or their passwords get compromised. I don't lose a penny if my bank gets hacked. When I lost my bank password, I just reset it. In the last 6 months, my bank account gained 1% during the time that bitcoin lost 70%.

>The hardware and electricity used to mine and secure the transaction hold plenty of value

Owning bitcoin doesn't give you any ownership of the hardware or electricity. That value is completely wasted. Bitcoin destroys valuable energy in return for useless tokens.

>What about when the next generation of digitally savvy investors come online?

Digitally savvy investors stay clear of asset bubbles and ponzi schemes. The price is tanking now because the supply of suckers is running out.



Probably still a much greater return than those suckered into buying BTC over 10000.
>You think many new investors will come into something thats last 70% of its value in the last 6 months?

Coming fresh off the heels of quadrupling in price in only 3 months. Yes, probably.

You say you're focused on the big picture but only mention the recent past. How about focusing on the fact that bitcoin was worth less than dirt 8 years ago and now it's the largest digital currency in the world. This bear market will look like minor turbulence once mass adoption starts to take place.
I didn't say that. It might drop even more tonight. It might drop below $5800 in the next 15 minutes. But it hasn't yet, so don't pretend it has.

If the facts have you so convinced it is going to fail, then share the facts. You don't need to lie.
It's more of a reflection of economic mismanagement than anything. Most countries don't have any issue with rampant inflation and people are still able to buy goods and services with their "evil fiat".
You can keep pressing your case.  At the end of the day, as I have said - karma is a thing.  So if you are not concerned that your behaviour will come back to haunt you, then continue with your trolling.
God you’re pathetic.

How can it be an income producing asset if it doesn't pay a dividend? If people bought Bitcoin in January they would have lost a lot of money by now. 
Not sure if you're for real or just trolling.
Its amazing
How does the idea of running out of funds for basic necessities during the last 5&#37; of your retirement life?

Stop being an idiot.
Yeah, why should money be a store of value, genius troll? By the way, I do, it's called bitcoin.
> But it‘s not actually unlimited because we have monetary policies that determine exactly what amount of money is currently needed in order to have the best conditions for our economy to run.

1 million dollar of US national debt for every bitcoin that will ever be mined. Enjoy your exactly determined policies.
Yeah I'm totally with you on all that man. You mentioned something that is often overlooked but extremely important. Crypto is still completely foreign to the overwhelming majority of people on the planet. It's like we're talking about putting a computer in every home in 1979. People argued that it would never catch on. No one really needed that. It's the same every time that we have a new technology
So why the fuck are you people on Bitcon Reddit?
I was very clearly referring to the future. I also clearly was referring to the bitcoin network being stable not the token price. The token price is obviously volile but in time it will most fluctuate far less.
> bitcoin was worth less than dirt 8 years ago

yes it had a bit increase in value

that does not mean it will happen again

sure, we all hope it will

but there is no guarantee it will

and its VERY likely that it will possibly not increase, and its also likely that it could lose much more

but hey...

i guess if anyone ever says anything on here other than "it can only go up" then they get attacked

that sort of irrational fervor and lack or even being willing to take warnings with heed is exactly the environment that leads to HUGE losses.

we'll see what happens.

I am not saying I can predict the future, i am just saying (In my opinion) bit coin will very likely continue to crash, and *perhaps* never recover.

You can agree or not, but why people are so opposed to any opinions that aren't their own i don't understand

its funny, i live in the USA, and here there is something called a "democrat"

they are people who seem normal in many ways, but their brains can't accept reality (they just think things like "hillary is wonderful and Donald Trump colluded with Trump to rig the US elections")

Now, thats obviously not true, but it you say anything that opposes them, they freak out and start calling you names.

i am not saying my fellow bitcoiners are as bad as "democrats" (no one is *that* bad), but there is a certain attitude here (among many) that ONLY one opinion is allowed, and that opinion is that you can only say that bitcoin will go up.

I don't know if it will go up, i am prepared either way. and i have invested, but *only as much as i can afford to lose*.

I don't expect it to go to the moon ...but i'll be happy if it does.  Other than that, i just wish i could be able to share my thoughts that BTC is on shaky ground without getting constantly critiqued for saying so.
For now. *shrugs* When he was a kid, my father used to ride his bike down to the corner store. He would buy a candy bar, a soda, and a submarine sandwich for 5.00 and come back with change.

These days, I can't even get the sandwich (even a shitty one from Subway) for that once you figure in the tax.

If he had bought gold instead, he'd be much better off today. But he didn't. Now he's poor.
You must be hurting.  

When you find yourself in a hole, first thing to do is stop digging.

Why don't you sell, take what you have and put it into something that will grow over time?
my point is that bitcoin NOT being an income producing asset is one of its strengths. 
ok lets talk about retirement funds dude.  You generally buy different funds depending on your age.  Younger people get put into riskier portfolios while older more conservative.  thats how my wife 401k works and she didn't know what she was in until i started researching it.  If you have a 100k in your retirement putting 1,000 into a Bitcoin ETF is not going to bankrupt you.  And what about 2008?  What if you retired then?  
Money needs to be a store of value in order to function as an intermediary for trade.  Isn't that obvious?

Yes, it's inflationary by design.  That's why most people will keep only a small amount for convenience.

Rest, we invest in vehicles that beat inflation.  I own BTC (no other cryptos) in my portfolio in addition to stocks, bonds and properties.

So what exactly is your issue?
Not saying everything's running perfectly. Just saying those systems are in place for a reason. Fixed amount currencies don't allow for an economy to run. 
There is no logical reason for bitcoin to become less volatile. It was intentionally designed to be deflationary, which means it will always have boom and bust cycles.
Dude, I own plenty since I started collecting way back when mining was possible on a PC.  

All I'm saying is that there are plenty of people here who have lost money and your gloating/trolling is not in good taste.
> Whoever thinks BTC is a good replacement for fiat needs to go back for Econ classes.

So why did you replace some of your fiat for bitcoin? Consistency isn't you strongest point is it, Mr. 1 day redditor and why do you insist in calling bitcoin BTC? Don't bother to answer, I'm done with you.

This this tact will work?  

Like, do a gut check and answer honestly.
Stop being so full of yourself.  BTC is bitcoin.

BTC is an investment for me.  You don't seem to be able to discern between investment and currency.
