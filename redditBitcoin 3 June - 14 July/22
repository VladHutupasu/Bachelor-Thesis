Daily Discussion, June 23, 2018 -- TITLE
Since December, as Bitcoin owners we've lost around 70&#37; of our money. Pretty much all gains since October have been erased. 

It's an easy come easy go game. You can lose money just as quickly as you can make money.
The day before yesterday an anonymous one bought 94K bitcoins for $ 6700. And yesterday the cost of bitcoin suddenly fell to $ 5938. Dude for the day lost $ 100 million.

I strongly believe that I can single handedly stop this drop if I simply sell. The market is really just fucking with me personally. 
did it deadly died?

Bit... Connect !
Finally, a 175 point plunge thru the 6000 barrier.  But the rise in volume was not substantial.  So stay tuned.  Jury is still out...
Go btc. We're all rooting for you.
There goes $6K and a new market cap bottom $243 lower than the April 4th market cap of $243.5 bill
Bitcoin market cap below $100 billion now
GG I died.  Gonna go invest in the next high tech sex toy.
**Whales, miners & the Illuminati**

Even whales had to buy their BTC at some price.   At the current price point they would be losing money, or facing a severe opportunity cost, by dumping on the market.

I've never been convinced by the whales theory.

Miners, on the other hand, may have only been selling the BTC they need to cover their mining costs, and sensibly hodling the rest, over a long period of time, as an investment.  Running costs aside - these are zero price BTC.

It is far more likely that what we are seeing is miners offloading coins.  It may, therefore, be temporary.

Regarding the Illuminati - it's got fuck all to do with daft conspiracies like that, that was just for fun.


Below 6k this weekend is a strong possibility
We're going to $2500
There she goes!  There she blows!
$6000 support broken this is about to get really ugly. 
In days like this is always wise to check this site kids!

Celebrating the new high-5900!
This is no longer "profit taking". people are selling at a loss. You have got to be the most retarded investor to be selling at these prices. 
I hope y'all shorted lol.
Another weak weekend sneaky sell-off foment attempt. Not many fish nibbling at the bait this time so far. Maybe the market manipulators are getting close to fishing this pond out?...
The very main reason for the price slump is the introduction of the. New anteater miner by coolysis, bitmain is dumpling bitcoin into the market to crush them before they hit the market in 4 weeks.. The anteater smokes the ant miner 9 in all ways of efficiency, speed and reliability and they are based in california.
If any whales are waiting for me to capitulate it will never happen.  I would hodl to 0 because I am literally the most stubborn mofo you will ever find.   

If I ever did sell I know it would probably immediately skyrocket back up, so fuck it!  Nobody’s getting my coins. 

And I’ll be buying here and there to the bottom.  Because I believe in bitcoin and you can’t take that away from me.  Hahahaha!
hodlr to sellr?

nights like these is when you sleep for 5 min, roll over and check the price then 
toss and turn, rinse and repeat. Beat your head against the pillow, cry, hodl yourself 
and fall asleep. In the morning, you wake up and you don't want to look at your phone but you do and 
then you say Fuck it, I'm not getting up. 
Look peeps.  We're near the bottom.  But "near" is relative. For people who haven't spent one penny on btc, when the height of insanity was 20k, and now we're at 6k, "near" could be $4500.  And that would be correct from their perspective.   Even $3500, could be near.  Or Maybe $6000 is the actual floor by consensus.  Who the hell knows?  For those who bought high, then "near" will never be near enough, as we continue to look for the floor.   I've already taken losses larger than most average people.  The only thing I'm worried about is a game changer, that could impact all of crypto currency.   A technological breakthrough, a new tech that surpasses the current one completely, or a flaw found in the foundation, or maybe a global economic contraction of the biblical kind.  That's what I get a bit concerned about.  Not the price floor seeking.  Let the sumbeech go to 4000.  I'll just buy some more.  It'll help with my earlier losses.  It also gives opportunity to people with lesser means when the price drops.  Patience is the word.  We could be riding the floor, plus or minus 15 percent for a long long time.This is not a new pattern...

Most "crypto personalities" or crypto institutions don't give a flying fuck about the actual assets. They only want as many USD as they can get. Or charge the highest amounts of fees and still having people use them. (Excluding Binance). Whales? No they don't pay feees. Bleed the middle class. Bleed the poor. Bleed everyone for fees. All these blow hards are confidence people. Pumping up shit like its about to happen tomorrow. Funny thing is, NO ONE HOLDS THEM ACCOUNTABLE. You think people like George Soros give a flying fuck about the actual concept of what bitcoin is? No. He sees a quick billion he can make and move on to the next venture start ups that fail over and over again. None of these people have real passion for the actual assets. Soros is probably the one dumping hard at midnight. Laughing while doing it. Then in a couple weeks China will legalize crypto and everything back green. THESE PEOPLE KNOW THE INSIDE INFORMATION. THEY KNOW EXACTLY WHEN TO BUY WHEN TO SELL TO GET OUT OF THE WAY BEFORE FUD HITS. IT'S A GAME. WE ARE ALL BEING PLAYED. YOU DON'T THINK THE BITIFINEX STORY WAS PLANNED ON FRIDAY??? OR THE JAPAN AML REGULATION FUD? ITS A JOKE! IF YOU CAN'T SEE THIS, YOU ARE BLIND OR JUST NAIVE.

LET'S GO BACK TO WHEN FACEBOOK 1ST BANS CRYPTO ADS, GOOGLE BANS CRYPTO ADS, TWITTER BANS CRYPTO ADS, SNAPCHAT BANS CRYPTO ADS. ONE. AT. A. TIME. DROPPING THE MARKETS 10&#37; FOR EACH ONE DOING IT. LIKE A GANGBANG BUKAKI. MEANWHILE EVERY MILLENIAL RETARD THAT DOES ZERO INVESTING RESEARCH CAN BUY FACEBOOK, APPLE, NETFLIX OR GOOGLE CALLS AND MAKE BETTER GAINS. WHILE SOME OF US SPEND HOURS READING WHITE PAPERS, UNDERSTANDING THE CONCEPTS, REAL WORLD APPLICATIONS WE CAN SEE, GET SHIT. WE GET TO JUMP INTO TETHER TO SAVE LIQUIDITY AFTER THE LAST FUD POST ABOUT SOME BUM FUCK EXCHANGE WITH $1 MILLION 24 VOL GETTING HACKED. SERIOUSLY WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK. THEN YOU HAVE SOUTH KOREA BANNING IT, NOT BANNING IT. INDIA BANNING IT BECAUSE THEY CAN'T COMPREHEND WHAT CRYPTOCURRENCY IS AND ARE SCARED STUCK LIVING IN 1900S SHITTING IN A HOLE IN THE MIDDLE OF A ROOM.

THIS SHIT IS EXHAUSTING AND A JOKE JUST LOOKING AT OBJECTIVELY THEY WAY MEDIA COVERAGE IS USED. ONE WEEK THEY ARE PUMPING IT, ONE WEEK THEY ARE BEARS. ITS SO OBVIOUS. IT'S WORSE THAN THE FED WITH INTEREST RATES ONLY THIS SHIT IS 24/7.
Birdman hand rub loll 
Somebody tell me where the hell is the bottom every time I think were there we fall even further
Still relatively low volume. Bad 
 You gotta stay relaxed Mr Belfort. Do you jerk off? 
just dont fucking sell
**It's time to hop off of Mr. Nakamoto's wild ride!**
At this stage all I can hold onto is the fact that there is a trillion dollar industry swimming around in this. I'm sure of it.....exchanges miners all the hardware all the employees. Its massive. If it all collapses it may take down economies which will ironically give bitcoin value again. Roflmao. A silver lining. Boom.
Well gang its been fun! but I'm jumping off Sotoshi's wild ride!  It was a blast kids, but this is the end :'( 

After a few months of trading i learned to dismiss the hype (hodl, buy the dip...), use stop loss and evaluate the crypto news and trends on my own. Being on the sideline for a while after selling, price is below my expectations, but i think it still can go lower a bit. Rebuy set at $5500 or $7000 if it bounces back up.
Anyone watching Bitfinex? Bunch of constant buy/sells of .002 over the last few minutes. 
Time to test 6k again.

Bitcoin out-performing all the other major coins in, er, not crashing as severely.

Good for Bitcoin :)

Lets set a positive tone today. The price is falling that just means its an opportunity to get more btc. The cheaper the price the more you get. 
Should we celebrating the new high 6100?
What else is new to the technology that makes you think it’s going to be different this year? It’s the same and everyone experienced it and didn’t like it. 
Nobody wants to talk about the price in the Price Talk chat. Part of the fun of talking about the price in the daily discussion thread is that it's annoying.
Will bitcoin difficulty change with this slump?!

Shit!

Where's the 6.23 meme?

r/cc is melting down. Hope that means we are finding a bottom. Fun either way.
in order to save the market, we need satoshi to make an appearance 
I think it's because bitmain is dumping bitcoin into the market to artificially suppress the price to try to take down DPW, the company that will be releasing the Anteater in 4 weeks. They are financially weak and may not be able to withstand a long price drop. The thing has a hash rate off 17.4Tb/s and runs cooler than anything ever made. It's also indestructible for African climates.made in california. Don't know how much is gonna cost.
Very simply put, bitmain has been rumored to have the same financial clout as alibaba. DPW holdings is in its infancy and heavily debt ridden, they have been backing that debt and the interest payments with bitcoin. Dpw cannot weather a storm like bitmain can. This miner runs cooler than any before and would be perfect for african ckimates and power shortages, using Samsung nanochips 17.4tb/s hash rate
Exciting times. Who would have ever thought that I could buy at these prices again.
I thought we were gonna free fall right to $5k yesterday but there is extremely strong support at $6k, safe to say it's the bottom.
[removed]
If the price doesn't bounce back, that means we're just gonna continue the same pattern. Hover around a price for a while, then dip. It's been doing the same thing over and over. When we actually hit the real bottom, that's when people are gonna jump in and buy in and create a big bounce before most of us get a chance to buy.
Idiots. The illuminati already told you that bitcoin will rise from the ashes. Remember the economist cover.

This is what you call a bubble guys.
If I had a billion dollars right now I’d buy a shitload of bitcoin all by myself and create a giant green middle finger to all the shorters, nocoiners, trolls, haters. Drive the price right up to 10k instantly.   😈
Financial institutions where financial year lasts from 1st July till 30th June are selling now, to fix their profits (or losses), and show cash in the balance sheets. Reason they sell: no real adoption of Bitcoin in the market, apart from supporting its own ecosystem. So for them (if they bought last summer of before) it gets strategically wise to sell now, and they buy again in new financial year, if they still want to trade it or own for some other good reason.

BS. I have not lost a single Bitcoin this year.

I feel better now 
Unrealized losses and gains versus actual loses or gains
If you bought last year still up 120% two years almost 800% 
I very much doubt he was thinking over a 24 hour period.  
It's how this rigged game works
(1) Bitcoin never fell to $5938. The whales have maintained support at the $6100 level. (2) Granting your $800 loss per Bitcoin assumption, then this whale would have lost $75 million not $100 million. Do the math. Nonetheless assuming he holds, he will soon recover that loss and even make great profits. But, I have no sympathy for someone who can drop $630 million on BTC assuming this madeup story is true. You know this guy is a billionaire and unlike us normal Joes, he has plenty of more money to use to recoup his losses. Basically, this is a guy who was up in Ritz Carlton hotels and drives a Bentley.
It’s a natural process. This has to happen. 

This is easy. The news is actually pretty damn good overall. Ive had to hold onto stocks when they have one foot in bankruptcy and all news was bad. That shit takes balls. 
[deleted]
Do.... it..! Take one for the team.
Taking it personally is a known phenomenon in these types of markets, and it's interesting that we have a tendency to react that way. It's an amazing display of confirmation bias.
This stupid statement is overused shut the fuck up.
You may have held for 2 months. Me as well.  I need a higher price. It could come.  
His “wife thought it was a scam but when he brings back stacks of money she doesn’t say anything anymore nuh huh”

[deleted]
Did you sell?
if that's true what you are writing, then it's pretty bad, nobody is going to step in at lower prices when the miners offloaded their positions 

it will scare any bulls away and give confirmation to the doubters that this is a bad investment

it will keep new buyers away because they will think 'glad i did not step into this' 

it will lambo seekers away because they already thought about buying the last 'dip' buy now or never at 12,10,8,6k and are very happy they didn't

this is not good for bitcoin

i saw friday cnbc calling out 'the funeral of bitcoin' and should we still cover bitcoin in the future with a strong NO

https://www.cnbc.com/video/2018/06/22/fast-moneys-bitcoin-funeral.html


Another week-long Bart Simpson an even stronger possibility
My frank opinion - it will flatline at around 6k for awhile.

And if it doesn't bounce off this line, it's really going to get bloody.

Edit - I'm going to take a 2.4x long at 6k so I'm putting my money where my mouth is.
[deleted]
boys we got us a whale enthusiast!? 

or you talkin' stripprs?
I just bought :P
Miners have to sell 
Umm... you have to be a retarded investor to still be holding. The writing has been on the wall for a while now. 
Doubtful. Anyone who bought before September is still good. Now, why they chose to sell now and not in December is beyond me, but hey...
[deleted]
Short these 🥜 hodl gang for life 
yes thank you for the money
How do you short Bitcoin, just curious
Or maybe there is no market manipulation at all and this reflects the a more accurate price of btc
Hmm.  Interesting.

Call me a conspiracist, but I think Dodger Ver's shitcoin may be more responsible for this.

I suspect his Bcash miners are dumping on the market (because it is a failed coin), and it is dragging the whole edifice down.

Maybe that's what Rog always wanted.  Care to respond Rog?  Or are you too busy saving babies.
A more efficient miner will be the one profiting a lower value BTC over a older tech miner. Why driving the price down to smother your own tech?
Nobody is ever smarter than the market.  The trend is your friend, so embrace it.  What you want to believe is meaningless.  The market creates the reality.
Every bubble needs suckers
How can you believe in Bitcoin but refuse to use it? Your said yourself that you'll never sell, so that means you'll never buy anything with Bitcoin. 

This is why Bitcoin is dropping, because no one actually wants to use it for anything. 

Even gold is used on a daily basis. This usage actually makes the store of value stronger. 

You can't build an economy around no one using it. 

The truth is you don't believe in Bitcoin, you believe in a get rich quick scheme. 
> you can’t take that away from me. 

They will however take your money from you. 
You know that's how it would go. We would hit the sell button and then go to sleep and wake up to a 15 or 20% rally
This is so fucking stupid.


Whales HAVE btc, they hodled for years and are happy to cash in whether at 20k or 5k. They have so much to sell that they play the "let the market recover" waiting game. And talk about how it will hit 500k while selling every uptick...
You’re losing sleep over an investment, which likely means you invested more than you could afford. I’ve done the same in the past and I strongly suggest against it for your own health.
Probably should have sold when 90% of everyone said this would happen
Only in Bitcoinland could watching Bitcoin fall further "help with my earlier losses."
What's a 'sumbeech'? 


Good one. This echos my senitment exactly. This drop is beneficial in every way, except for the weird looks I get from friends and family who think I'm an idiot for investing in internet money.
I agree with you although crypto moves at a much faster pace then previous markets.  I think we will continue to move sideways until more adoption comes along or real life use cases other than another means of currency come to light.

Gangbang bukaki lol.  You right on the manipulation, but you need to take a step back, buy the lows, and profit out of all proportion when you ride the coattails of the institutional money to the top, while those facebook/yahoo investing millenials watch in shock
Strong support at ~~8k~~ ~~7k~~ ~~6k~~ 5k
There's definitely a bottom at $0.  I swear it can't go lower than that.  Promise.
Probably not until $5,500 range although I don’t expect to stay within 5k range too long too many buyers

automated computer trades.   it's a common practice in all sorts of markets.    for like 3 decades...
I run a similar bot they are probably just riding the volitality making the markets buying little bits as it falls and selling on the way up.

Having a stop loss is a terrible idea!

Cares? Bitcoin owners are users of the technology, not patent licensors of the technology. How much do folks make just by owning an iPhone?

Not yet. At this price, miners are going to move their ASIC to third world countries and make coins with coal...
Nope, with the current hashrate growth the next diff will go up like 20%

https://fork.lol/pow/retarget
The difficulty changes in response to how long it takes to mine a block. Every 2016 blocks (exactly 2 weeks if blocks are produced every 10 minutes) the difficulty is adjusted so that the just-completed 2016 blocks would have taken exactly 2 weeks. 

(New difficulty Target)=(Old difficulty Target)*(time taken to complete 2016 blocks)/(time it should have taken)
Hey... I'm not an attention whore!
Urban dictionary: Retard: Someone who uses the term retard.
more like drop to $4k and sideways for a few years. Bitcoin has been around for almost a decade now. No reason it should be priced at $6000, huge spiked in just 1 year, when there are no real applications. It needs to drop back to 3k-4k until more progress is made on the development side.
Denial? 
That's the dumbest thing I've heard all week

I hope you're right, but I don't feel like anything is safe to say these days. Everything seems like the bottom until it isn't.
Ummmm, the bottom is zero. At 19000 you needed a telescope to see it, at 12000 you needed binoculars to see it, but now you just need to look down.
Dump it 
Many have said the same at 7k, 6.5k, 6.2k....

This is just the beggining of the pain...
Explain to a retard please. 
Wait for two Bart Simpsons and a Fuzzy Poodle first.

You don't understand the meaning and origin of the word Ponzi, do you?  :)

And looking at your post history, you are a shorter.
Here's a lovely quote from you:

*What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little no-coiner? I’ll have you know I graduated top of Cred's private classes, and I’ve been involved in numerous pump and dumps on Binance, and I have over 300 succesful recorded trades. I am trained in ICT Fibs and I’m the top sniper in the entire BitMEX trollbox. You are nothing to me but just another liquidation. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words.*

What a charmer you are  :)

How about you leave our rather pleasant sub?
Yeah might wanna look words up before using them. I guess you don’t get what a ponzi is 
So last week the crash troll talking points was to use the word“delusional” as much as possible. This week it’s “ponzi”.

Financial institutions don't need to show cash in balance sheets with their trading capital, positions are valued and reported they don't need to sell to report that. 

What you say is factually completely wrong. 

First of all, financial institutions trade OTC and this has no impact on the market.

Second of all, financial institutions don't take positions in crypto

please stop posting you know nothing
LOL always some excuse. So much delusion on this sub.

Do you want a biscuit for guessing it would drop, gambler?

Because some of us here don’t give a shit what happens to the price of bitcoin in the short term span of months, when we know in our bones that it will be worth exponentially more over the course of years.  

but thats what they said about buying the dip at 15k
Yes, we're a little old for you, I suspect.
Hey, don't assume gender.
Give us a break .... 

All these retarded talk about "evils of central banking" and in the same sentence, you talk about BTC's price in USD.

Fucking moron.
I know bitcoins been weak af but im optimistic it could break out on wave D, like if btc goes to any lower than 4k who's really gonna buy it thinking it can get back to 20k anytime soon and even if it does would it hold? I know in the past it had worse corrections but the market cap was so much smaller and bitcoin was an underground thing, its on the news now and everyone is gonna bash the hell out of it if it sinks that low imo. if investors don't like bitcoin at 5k how are investors gonna like it at 20k

Exactly.   People call those floors.  They're wrong. They were warning shots, and telling us where we were headed.   It doesn't mean that we can't go lower.  It just gives a round about idea where we're going deflate to, and possibly beyond.

Why is *time* so often left out of these analyses?  :)

One very welcome effect of this may be to kill the shitcoins - there are far too many alts.  BTC dominance is already rising.
It's not really FUD, it's just another guess. Everyone here is guessing.
How mature, screenshooting people’s opinions. 
Can confirm, am retarded. 
Retarded for holding some of us have no choice you idiot we’re not rich yanking keep dumping money back into the market every time there’s a downturn we’re not gonna take a 70% loss are you foolish exactly why 90% of traders lose in the long run because eventually you’re going to get caught with your pants down trying to time the market and get slapped right in the face but again I guess it doesn’t matter for rich people like you you can just dump 100,000 more dollars back into it make up for your loss. Only an idiot is selling right now if you even understood what is what was around the corner people need to look beyond the tape and see this is clear market manipulation to get these prices as low as possible the big institutional guys are mad they weren’t in the stuff when it was cheap so they’re going to do whatever they can to get it back to where it is cheap so they can go ahead and come in the writing is right there in the wall it’s real simple all these trading desk run by Fidelity Goldman Sachs they’re going to get there liquidy up before they start getting their clients and their 401(k)s and retirement plans involved and when that happens guess what all those coins are going to be held not sold. They’ll be taking clients money and invest in it for long term and guess what you’re not going to be able to buy a cheap bitcoin anymore because it’s going to be trillions of dollars in the market have fun trying to time the market buddy see you in the soup line eventually when your millions run out. Give advice stay up on the news read up on Fidelity read up on what’s going on instead of just running your trap thinking you’re some big hot shot master traitor you’d be running Goldman Sachs or Fidelity yourself if you’re that good at it I can’t wait to ride passed you while you’re in the soup line in my Lamborghini or Ferrari once bit coins $250,000. That goes for anybody who thinks just like him and the rest of us hodlers I got your back. Remind me of the guys said to sell bitcoin when it was $150 I remember that said it was never going to go beyond that said it was in a bubble just makes me laugh now it’s so Ludacris 
Someone is always holding
wow you're so right. I guess I was too busy reading positive headlines such as Governments ligitimizing crypto AND Banks starting to invest/open exchanges AND countires adopting blockchain tech AND Wall street/Hege funds considering Bitcoin AND etc etc...wow how stupid of me. Just for fun, where's this wall?

Greed will kill you guys
4 bitcoin means you have more bitcoin than an average city would ever be able to own. Just sit back and wait for retirement...
Look up margin trading on bitmex, and how to use leverage
As long as there are market economies there will be market manipulation. If you mean that MM isn't a substantial factor in the crypto price discovery dynamic, then sure, maybe.
Lol
Meaning the short sellers? because we have had this massive short bubble form. 20000 to 5000 and change in a few months

Seriously any argument you make about the long side in 2017 is now staring right at you on the short side in 2018 as far as bubbles go


Get a clue. There is a difference between selling for fiat on an exchange and using it to buy things. I do spend it and after I do, I immediately replenish it with fiat. I only wish there were currently more opportunities to use it. 


Only if I need the money in short term. And I don’t.   So since I’m not selling, I’m not losing anything.   In a few years all this will be a distant memory - bitcoin will be way up by then. 
It baffles me when people say stuff like that. I invested a few grand, that turned into a few hundred grand, and yes I get literally sick to my stomach watching it drop but I didn't invest a penny I couldn't afford to lose.
well not exactly...

While I did spend more than I could afford at the time, it turned out in my favor and I made a nice profit but like everyone else, have seen it dwindle away, unrealized, of course. I was going to use my profit to pay off my home mortgage and ease up my finances to the point I could change jobs and find something for less pay that I enjoy a heck of a lot more! So, after I finally made the decision, before I could get home it started tanking and has been in this free-fall for a while so any restlessness is because I am still stuck at my crappy job and still have a mortgage payment. Just been waiting to see that spike to get me back to where I need to be. 

...but you are right, it does affect your health. Heck it goes back to December numbers before the end of the year, I will be able to retire very early. Thanks, mate
Er, '90% of everyone' said BTC would never be worth more than a grand!
haha so true brother!

If you're arguing it should underperform stocks I suppose that would be true. I'm thinking of one stock that I bought just a few months ago I have banged out a  50% return on. 

I mean where do you even come up with this shit. It should not be priced at 6,000 but it should be priced at 3 or 4? did you just pull that out of the sky?
Delusion!
Stick around for the down 10%. Days.   That's when the real comedy nuggets show up

You must not have gone to any of the recent meetings. We had to punt all that satanic stuff, since they wanted WAY too much in licensing and franchise fees.
What an ape :D
How new are you to the internet? You know that's a joke, right?
I'm guessing the idea is that at this point we can safely say that BTC has no actual use (because next to no one is using it as currency) and people are only getting in in the hopes of more people getting in after them, thus raising the value of their investment.
because pump and dump as proved lately
Not true I bet the bots the whales use read Reddit and get a general feel for how us commoners will react.

Coz 1=btc could be worth nothing.

they always will be in denial , even at 1
True.  A man can dream tho. 
Or turn 1 billion into 1.5 billion in weeks.  Fomo would be off the chart above 10k 
At least I wouldn’t be selling it back on the exchange 
If anything this spicy copypasta lends him more credibility. 
You don't sound convincing when you are here 24x7 attacking any negative comment about "price of bitcoin in the short term".

Like I said - You are just a cheap rent seeker and a hypocrite.
Good on you to admit you're in this purely for the money. If so, i recommend selling now before it drops thousands more. 
 Bitcoin is a long term play.

It will never return to 20k.

I'm going to archive this thread!!!
I get the idea that many of the folks here are also sitting on piles of Iraqi dinars, waiting for that big RV that was supposed to happen about 10 years ago (but will occur next weekend and they'll be fabulously rich, doncha know).

Stfu lmaooo You are a nobody... Think you know the market? Come back to reality.. Nobody knows the crypto market
Chill out man I agree on hodling and price will go up but patient and it’ll come. Look at all the people That had a hold from 2014 until now? It will happen and we will see a $50,000 bitcoin when? Well that’s another story for now just buy your coins cheap put them on your ledger and forget about it
...... and watching 👹
Why would anyone sell at -60% when they believe this bear market will turn around? It’s not greed. It’s common sense.
what if it's not

you loose
If you believe in the tech, your quantity of coins has not decreased. You still own a percentage of the supply, you've lost nothing. Price is irrelevant. The fact you freak out instead of seeing it as an opportunity to accumulate more for cheap tells me you don't believe in the tech or you uncertain (same thing).
that is exactly what I did, as well. 

Everyone in my family dies by the time they are 60 for whatever reason, just bad genes I guess. So, I decided why let the state have any of my life insurance money and pulled out what I could take as a loan. I used that to fuel my purchases and had the results you did. I wanted to retire and have a good 10-15 years before my gene's say it time.
bravo my argument is ruined! back when bitcoin had no exposure i'm sure many people were wrong, but bitcoin has been in the public eye for a few months now and I think the professionals opinion is a little bit more credible now
And the gambler who stays at the table to try to make up for the prior losses that he couldn't afford in the first place, and we all know how that usually turns out.
$0 is strange. Negative is more likely. (Paying people to take BTC)
Where those buys or sells or was it buy sell buy sell? They are trying to make tiny bots of profit of each trade and just keep trading as the price goes up and down. You figure they make 10¢ per trade buying 1 btc at a time after 1000 trades they make $100 assuming they don't have any orders hanging. 

Also I plan on open sourcing my bot in short bit if ppl are interested. Still got a few things to smooth out and to write a manual...
Who paid you to write that?

Get out of my whorehouse.

Benziebawks is the best attention whore on these boards.  Medically cleared and everything.
Stocks?  Love my Netflix .... up 104% this year, best performing in my portfolio :)

Good point, there's no reason to believe it should be priced above 0
Well of course they are melting down.  

They are mainly altcoiners/shitcoiners riding on the back of Bitcoin.

Now they are fucked.  Well fuck them!

Good for Bitcoin :)

(I think I'll cross-post something like this over there ..)

The likelihood of that is so close to zero as to be disregarded.

No it’s worth 1btc. I thought you understood this.

if you would have done that the whole world would see a chance to dump their position and they would

So is death, if you're lucky.
then wave E will just be death of crypto ??? or you think we still in the euphoria stage and we bounce from 3900 to 15k then die.. im pretty much at the point of if wave D doesn't hold ill be taking my inflated fiat elsewhere

Nobody knows, not even you 
HODL GANG
Your self-obsession knows no bounds, troll.
You've chosen wisely because something is about to happen.
> He will feel very "lucky" he bought at that price by years end

Why? How do you know?
> That's not how I measure "luck", he hasn't lost anything if he is not day-trading. He will feel very "lucky" he bought at that price by years end.

Yes, that is right. But I think that today's cost of bitcoin still makes him nervous.
No dude, it was *literally* [a joke.](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2018/06/22/fast-money-trader-brian-kelly-says-bitcoin-isnt-dead-yet.html)
At this point it’s the principle of the thing. I’m supporting something I believe in.  Que será, será

The-Physicist - are you loose?
Quick math lesson. $200k buys a lot more coins than $70k. 
Ouch, only 60, that sucks! My parents died at 49/48 respectively 9 years apart from natural causes but I hope to out live them both and by about 40 years!
You didn't say professionals - you said 90% of everyone!

(Not that the 'professionals' have any clue either in this market.)
Well you're all wrong.  It seems it is a contraction of Son of a bitch.
Losses are inevitable.  It's part of the game.  The only way to have zero losses, is to not play.  Even tried and true stock market strategies all incur losses.   All risk/reward ventures entail losses.  Short players have an important role keeping the market honest. But they take losses just like everyone.  It's about managing for the long term. And looking far enough out.   Keep diversified.  For people with small amounts of capital, their best investment is themselves.  Earn, and save.  Earn, and save.  The nice thing about  being young, is that you can take $500, or $1000, and put it into something like bitcoin when it comes along. Maybe it'll pay off. But if you lose it, it doesn't even represent a drop in bucket of a lifetime of earnings.  Just don't make it a habit to buy at 20k, and sell at 5k.  ;-)
They were buy/sells, so I get what you are saying but it was for .002 Bitcoin asking at those prices.

Dsx Greek dry bulk carrier. One of the better ones really. Bought it at 3.50 in and April . closed 5.10 Friday. The Baltic dry index had a multi-decade low in 2016 and it's been making a series of higher highs and higher lows ever since. The better companies in that sector are coming off of multi-decade lows as well. 
Then why are you even here? If you feel there is no value at all what are you getting from hanging around? Go find something you believe in and support that
Do it. It may be a guilty pleasure but this is fun to watch.
More of an algo trading stock market phenomenon.. but it will find it's way into crypto as automated , hft grows larger


I'm amazed at your patience. I gave up trying to make people see sense a long time ago. It's amazing how shortsighted they can be.
(Now look, the river through Paris is called the Seine.  Does that help?)
Man you have zero faith in humanity 
So morbid for a Saturday 
after wave-e rally is complete, then crypto dies and won't come back.

if wave-d fails as support around 5700, death comes sooner.

usa dollar bear market to resume.


It's just how we speak here to get more people to buy, so the price goes up

"Yet"
I hope it works and turns around for you, good luck
sorry english is my 4th language, i will try better 
So you getting sick to your stomach that you can't buy more? Drama queen.
Right, but "chasing losses" is usually the surest way to further losses.
maybe he supports fools not being parted from their money
Oops.  I feel a ban coming on ..

It is just that you can't disinvent technologies.  Cryptocurrencies are here to stay, and Bitcoin is the most trusted and proven one.

So the logic follows: if Bitcoin fails, an entire technology is abandoned.  The likelihood of that is close to zero.

The entire market, however, is a mess.  Anyone with any critical sense can see that.  There are hundreds of random, valueless coins - with no discernable new technology to offer - making gains of hundreds of percent overnight - that is completely unsustainable. 

So in that sense, there probably needs to be a 'crisis' like this to shake out all that nonsense.  The market has been pregnant for that culling for months.

My only real change in view since Jan 2018 is that the timescale for recovery may be longer than expected.


idk lets see if we break 7800 after this dip maybe bitcoin really is a unicorn. last June btc had the same correction on a smaller scale and it broke out to bull run. 
usd bear market to resume? what are you smoking? the fed is tightening. 

if you don't believe it's ever going to rally again go short with no stops and post daily screen shots
He will not be afraid only if he can influence the rate of bitcoin, or he does not feel sorry for the money invested.
?
Not sure I believe you’re sincere. You’ve been talking down bitcoin since day one.  Just another shorter/noicoiner probably.  

If I didn’t care/believe in something I wouldn’t spend so much time posting in a subreddit about that thing i don’t care about unless I had an agenda.  
My apologies too.  I didn't know.  It is a mistake many English speakers make.
I think arguing going to zero would be the exact opposite of that. It would be everyone being parted from all of their money.. 

That said I don't really understand why the trolls haven't figured this out yet. If they spend their time trolling they aren't really doing anything productive with their own life. I mean if you spend your time criticizing and being negative about practically anything what do you really accomplish for yourself?
I like it.
I agree with your sentiments. However, the only thing I think this "crash" will do is scare off those who bought high and sold low. Most of these people got/are going to get badly burned and will probably never buy back in. Newbies coming in post-"crash" of 2018 will just go through the same pains. Rinse and repeat all the way up to the moon.

In the longer term I don't think this "crash" is going to change much of the market. The more serious shitcoins are just going to ride through the turbulence and live to scam another day.

I guess we're both here longterm though so we'll  find out soon enough.
 
They said 

"Bitcoin is not dead 'yet' "

But it's dying is my take on it
I'm short BTC because i see these up moves getting faded instantly so I take profit from that. 

That doesn't mean I want you to fail or loose money, you have your idea and strategy and personally I hope you succeed. I'm just on the other side making money instead of losing money. 
ha, so i'm not the only one, it's okay, ps: i'm not an english speaker
Maybe a bit strong?  Heh.
What the hell does that have to do with anything? At least admit that the video you cited as "proof" was irrelevant to your cause (whatever that may be...)
He's not losing money. If you make a bit extra, great. But hodling at these prices is not losing a thing.
You still short?  My gosh, I closed mine at 7k.

Just took a long position at 6k.
Fine. But you are betting against the thing I care about and constantly talking it down in this subreddit (like many others) to your own financial advantage.  I have no respect for that. 
I'm one of those twats with an obsession about correct English.  Probably because, well, 1. I'm a twat. 2. I'm getting old.
Godspeed.
If he bought above current price, of course he lost.

All these crap about "don't lose unless you sell" is stupid.  The net value of your current assets is what counts.
I actually took profit and closed just a minute ago, if it pops up I will short again. 
yeah well you do the same but on the other side for your own financial advantage

i have respect for that


I have creamed off 7-figure shorting BTC so eat me.
hey look at it this way, I'll probably never in my life write "loose" again when i mean "lose"

so, THANKS!
You have the completely wrong attitude. Try telling that to investors in 2014. Looking at the value of your cryptocurrency in terms of fiat is just a sign you're another speculator. The only investors I know of that still look at their bitcoin in terms of fiat value are post 2017 amateurs.
Keep telling yourself it’s the same, when it’s not. It probably helps you sleep better at night since your short selling is harming the chances of a new technology which allows humanity unprecedented financial freedom to gain traction.  The price of bitcoin going down is not a good look. 
It is odd, because 'lose' as it is spelt should really rhyme with, say, 'close' - but as you know, English spelling isn't at all logical.  

Another confusion is lead (v), led (past tense of lead), lead (noun, the metal), the first and last spelt identically but pronounced differently.  

And then we have 'spelt' and 'spelled' - well the jury is out on that one :)
Thanks for your support🙂. There are many crash trolls like btc4trade here. I can use all the help I can get. 
Dude, a loss is a loss.  

Don't even start giving me advice as I have been in this game a long, long time.
 "the chances of a new technology which allows humanity unprecedented financial freedom" the price dropping suggests that maybe it wasn't really that.  Like maybe you are holding onto it wishing it was that when it clearly isn't.  What if it's you who is preventing something like that from becoming a reality by clinging to something that clearly isn't working?  You don't get to claim moral high ground from wanting something you own to increase in value and give you free money 
[deleted]
I know I thought they were joking when they said bitcoin reddit was toxic. Everyone is making a big fuss about this crash, nobody needs more idiots making them feel bad because they didn't extract every cent out of it. The next bull run will make this crash a flat line on a chart, and anyone who sticks around should be encouraged.
Did he lose some quantity of his crypto? What did he lose? Whats the loss? Value compared to the currency its making obsolete? Speculators like you make me sick, and I hope you sell so the market can move forward again. 
No, i can’t sit idly by and watch a bunch of selfish greedy shorters/nocoiners intentionally try to  drive the price down for myriad agendas.  This potentially harms and delays the adoption of bitcoin.  I recognize there is a non zero chance their nefarious efforts could be successful at delaying adoption for many years longer than it should.  

Your insults are pointless.  I will keep fighting this war for currency independence.   You can go back to your bear den circle jerk now.  Good try. 


His explicitly stated aim is that his BTC holdings will moon measured in fiat.  By his own definition, his BTC has lost value measured in fiat.

"Paper loss is no loss" is a mantra of losers to make themselves feel better.  Like you.

Everyone is a speculator here.  The only difference is the time horizon.  And having a longer term perspective doesn't make you any less a speculator.

So get off your high horse as you are just an idiot in my view.
