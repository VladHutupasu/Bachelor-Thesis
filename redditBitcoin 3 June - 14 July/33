Will we hold? Will ETF be announced? Will McAfee eat his dick? Find out next time on DBZ.
I'm cashing out at 10 dollars, want to get at least a 6 pack of beer out of my 10k investment.
This is good for Bitcoin.
Now hand me that hand grenade...
Well fuck. 
Bull run soon right guys? Lol I’ll never learn.  
If you turn the bitcoin chart upside down...it's mooning :)
This is good for Bitcoin.
Here, take some Prozac...

>As an amusing thought experiment, imagine that Bitcoin is successful and becomes the dominant payment system in use throughout the world.  Then the total value of the currency should be equal to the total value of all the wealth in the world. Current estimates of total worldwide household wealth that I have found range from $100 trillion to $300 trillion. With 20 million coins, that gives each coin a value of about $10 million.  So the possibility of generating coins today with a few cents of compute time may be quite a good bet, with a payoff of something like 100 million to 1! Even if the odds of Bitcoin succeeding to this degree are slim, are they really 100 million to one against? Something to think about...

How low do you think we are going?  I have to admit this is looking really bad at the moment.
I’m just glad they are filtering out this bad actors. Ver will be barred and fined heavily as well as Armstrong and some of his employees. They hurt the technology they claim they love more than anyone. They purposely slowed adoption and manipulated the price. 
I’m posting this on daily trend so it’s not distributed outside the affected people who these people hurt the most. Senators and congress members got letters daily about Ver scamming them into thinking they were buying bitcoin. I said last month that congress will act if you hurt the older people who actually vote. Inside information here. Take it as you want but bitcoin is discounted now and enjoy. Ver will be held accountable. Armstrong has plausible deniability he’ll claim but will get fined heavily. Ver May be banned from the financial system and japan will levy fines or jail with the evidence we got. 
Anyone else waiting for Consensus 2019.  
Well I have been buying all the dips and HODLing and now I finally have 0.5 BTC. My goal is to have a full BTC.
HODLER since the start of 2017.  Invested heavily through this year, this is getting tough guys.  A little bit of good news would feel pretty great after the last 6 months.
Weeeeeeeeeeeh !!!
BTC is dead for the 432nd time today 

She’s a lady. A psychotic testing lady. Be careful if she wakes up because she might surprise you. 
Let this be the bottom please.
Strong support at 6300 Russian rubles...
This isn't the end, it's an opportunity!! I'ma just buy some real freaking cheap coin right now. :)
McAfee better get that hot sauce ready
Oh FFS I keep buying the dip and it keeps dipping.....I need to go for a walk
bulls are back boiz
bitcoin is retesting 6500 support. let's wish it luck guys :)
Bitcoin is worth 6000$, and people acting here like the world has ended, such idiocy.

Same people who come back in at 12k when they already missed out on a 100&#37; rise. Hoping to catch a spike to 15K but instead sell again when it goes down to 9k.
I'm excited for new development of north Korea I believe they will be very similar to the south with technology based economics. 
when bart to 7000.
If someone could buy like 1000 Bitcoin that'd be swell. Thanks.
I posted this 2 weeks ago before the Fed investigation was announced:

“Wait till August. Rule #1: don’t scam older American voters cause they donate to campaigns and have the ears of senators. When August comes around, I want you to remember this. He’s already trying to apologize and changed his website. That’s not enough. Plus he can’t plead the fifth without jail time. His website confused older people and they are furious. I’ll tell you how I know after this goes down. It’s ashame cause he was respected but decided he wanted to go back to his messiah complex. If he stuck with bitcoin, he would have had to wait a year but he could have helped so much. Now he’s going to answer for his crime and he weakened bitcoin and set it back 2 years. August or September you’ll see. “


Just wondering why certain posts are removed if they don't necessarily paint a positive picture of Bitcoin? If they are truthful and legit should they not be considered informative? 
I’m really glad I mined most of my coins so I can just hold thru this and not give AF.

THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT CONSIDERS RELAXING THE BAN ON CRYPTOCURRENCY TRADING
Posted by Fintech Crypto News | Jun 11, 2018 
There’s a post on r/cc about how bat shit crazy fanboys the mods are that they ban anyone who mentions literally anything remotely negative about BTC. Please tell me this isn’t true..the sub with the greatest followers can’t be ruled by such delusional man child’s..
I just can’t believe you’re going to lose 90% of your money just because of HODL meme. Damn.
So is this thread now BTC day traders ?\- it time to buy discount coins, or it is still up 6k form years ago I guess its point of view   
There goes the neighborhood...
[Perfect video to describe these moments!](https://youtu.be/3edi2Wkr5YI?t=25s)
Help
God I hope we don't have to reuse $100b market cap memes again
#BTC Rocket to the moon started!  
Buy cheap !  
Why is coinbase making you verify your account with a drivers license and where can I buy bitcoin right now without having to give some information of an ID.
omg guys, prepare for moon. Check out this lemonade stand **that accepts** [BITCOIN!!](https://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/4563348)
Everyone got their $7k memes ready?
Reminder, the "bottom" was more than 4 months ago. Onward and Upward! 
We have been here before, we have also bounced back, it's just the nature of the crypto market.
Until we get used to it, it always feels so deep. 
The floor is the limit.
 dont know why i have the feeling that we are going to close 2018 the same way 2017 started. 
I'm still buying...
HODL!!!

What r main reasons of this dip......?

Unfortunately the average joe/Jane will link bitcoin’s “safety” to the security of exchanges.
great thing, I left the right time, to get back in later.
No way hodlll, buy more in later

Im long Bitcoin today Weds Asia time Bitcoin will bounce soon
Guys iam selling everything i have. i started to believe in fiat system and universal income. Helicopter inflation money will solve every problem we have now.
Probably the most beginner question you read today:  
  
If I am logged into a site that accepts bitcoin as payment (think retailer like amazon) and I buy something, they show me their wallet adress during checkout.  
I then send the funds from my cellphone via an app to that adress.  
  
Question:  
How does the seller know that I (the guy logged into their site making a purchase) was the one sending the bitcoins? Is this adress that I send bitcoins to dynamic and so once funds arrived they knew it was send by me?    

I can't really wrap my mind around how a merchant verifies from where payments come from. I gathered this adress they show during checkout is just like their bank account number. i.e The same for everyone. Only with a bankaccount number, when you accept payment you can make people add additional information like order number in the comment fields so they can connect the payment to an order. 
It's not too late to sell guys. Remember, 6700 > 5000. It's mathematically proven. 
Had an interesting conversation with my wife this morning:

Her: The price of BTC has dropped because a third of it was stolen at the weekend

Bear this in mind she does not care about BTC we rarely discuss it

She is massively into shitbook, love island and all that bollocks

I asked her where she read this, she replied she did not know

Intrigued me that's the kind of battle 'we' are up against

Just a random throwaway article she has read somewhere
Once everyone is convinced that the price is sure to drop, it is then that the price rises. 
Traders, don't make a long move until it holds the April 1st low. If it breaks through the floor, next support is south of
$5K.  Have a good trip.  See you next fall.  

i guess we were the greater fools after all
They see me hodlin' - they hatin'.
Buy now and be a bag boy for the HODLers to the south.  Greater Fools always wanted.  Apply, today.
HODL!!!
HODLLLL !
All the comments make me believe we are rebounding very shortly.


If the 6400-6500 double-bottom is going to offer support, expect to see a very high volume flag upward.  Next,
watch for overhead supply pressures at 7400-7500.  If positive volume can't eat through this, then we're in another tight trading range. It is probably best to short this, if the trading graph makes one lower-high, followed by a lower-low.  At that point, you're probably not going to the moon without a further retest of 6535.  If it holds above this, as volume really dries up, then another long burst could see the price cutting through 7400-7500 resistence.
bulls are back boiz
get ready for the drop.  about to hit 6200\-6300, i say high 5000's by saturday.
Huge pump coming

Bitcoin is The People’s Currency ™. 

Buy the cheap coins now from the whales and take your power back.  We will chip away at them bitcoin by bitcoin until we win. 

The war for currency independence is raging. Fight with us!

I just want to remember everybody that on this 12th of june of past year BTC was @ $2,628

Thanks for your attention and have a good week!
The Support at 6500 must hold! Tested the 4th  time now. Hopefully the bottom :-(
Bitcoin falling Wedge. will 6.2 save us?

Oh the humanity!
[https://youtu.be/1lWJXDG2i0A](https://youtu.be/1lWJXDG2i0A)
Very bullish price action! This sell off is healthy and will only help solidify bitcoin. I think we'll see $6k before bouncing back VERY strongly to $10\-15k in July.
here we go again
Support at 6500 is not completely broken yet.  Will he be able to withstand again? 
At this rate I can stop mining tomorrow. What a tease last month was :-(
[removed]
The pump will be done by Bitfinex guys when the amount of shorts is high enough... 30-35k
Bit coin 2 $100,000 by December 2019, I’m down 80% from January thanks to all the YouTubeea  telling us to get in get in get in now I firmly believe bitcoin will be $100,000 by 2019 2020 by the latest go bitcoin I’m banking on the institutional money injected into the market getting us to this point within a couple years
Coinrail. My question for anybody who knows about whales manipulating the market is...we know that the Coinrail hack is not remotely the cause for this latest fall. So, I have one of two theories: (1) most probable theory: the whales were waiting for the perfect opportunity to crash Bitcoin and the Coinrail hack is the perfect coverup even though the whales don’t exactly need a cause to crash the cryptocurrency market. (2) The whales were planning on a crash beginning June 10th and the Coinrail hack coincidentally fell at the same time. Also, it’s not crazy to rule out the whales could be involved in hacking Coinrail thus giving them the rationale needed to why Bitcoin has fallen. Any thoughts?
As a proud shorter, I’d like to say HODLERS getting recked! God it feels good to say that after hearing damn HODLers brag everything with “shorters getting recked.” Ahahaha at HODLers pissing their pants tonight.
Feast your eyes on this:

Yup, this shit is going to hell confirmed.
We need Donald Trump to tweet #jobs #bitcoin #jobs #bitcoin #jobs #bitcoin #jobs #bitcoin #jobs #bitcoin #jobs #bitcoin 

Nobody wants to buy Bitcoin anymore. 
Google searches for Bitcoin are up!

Ven...am I banned now too?
We're all gonna die!!!
Lol my friend just shorted 7k worth he bought at 17k well I feel better about my loss  now
Thank you to everybody that is selling. We finally had a reasonable way to dethrone the banks that have an extreme chokehold on the world. 

Thank you so much for proving the bankers right that said bitcoin is a bubble and will crash to zero while they take 700 billion dollar bailouts to lend your own money back to you while paying themselves million dollar bonuses with said money. Bravo. 
A month ago, I told you guys this would fall to $6k in about a month and here we go. 

EDIT: Only on reddit does one get downvoted for being right.
Soooooo bitcoin keeps going lower... :D
I have more than most people invested in crypto. I bought my coins with the intention of holding each one for a period of years. The period of years has not yet finished. I will not sell ANY crypto until the period has been completed. This is my investment strategy. Time in the market > timing the market.

Should I have $0 at the end of the period, at least I know that I saw my plan through to the end without my nerves getting the better of me. What I am trying to say here is that the price at the moment, at least to me, is truly of no concern.

I did not sell my BTC at $20k and I will not sell it if it hits $5k again until the time is up. If BTC were to hit $20k again tomorrow, I still would not sell.


Futures killed Bitcoin. We will never see even 9k again. Either get completely out of Cryptocurrencies now or move into other coins. George Soros, Bill Gates, Warren Buffet and Jamie Dimon have won.

Bitcoin is done. Too many powerful people kicking it down.
Bitcoin's looking healthy overall, slight corrections are normal and this type of two steps forward one step back progression is MUCH more healthy and sustainable that mooning period all of a sudden followed by huge crash. HODL strong guys! 
Annnd I’m homeless again. I’m about to move my entire portfolio back over to stocks until crypto stops crashing so hard. 
this BNB is kinda getting ridiculous ?! i just wait for the part where they keep saying its closer to satoshis whitepaper... 
Better tiptoe thru the tulips.  The mania may be ending.
I will venture to say that the bottom is in. Buy now. 
Bitcoin 4$k when?
Crypto is dead buy the pump not the dip if it ever happens in our life time

get ready for the big dump.  $6000 is incoming
Is there a cold wallet (other than nano and trezor) that can store ALL coins? It is clear to me that next year will usher in more useless, draconian crypto laws and regs that make it not feasible to use exchanges for much of anything except tracking your txns for big brother. By then, I'm sure "KYC\-AML" will include retinal scanning and and DNA, irrespective of how long you have already used the exchange. We all know these laws have everything to do with government attempts to track tax revenue. *The 'money laundering' cover story is laughable; especially when one considers how busted and bankrupt most governments are. These corrupt, disreputable institutions who try so hard "to protect us" from ourselves, are flipping every couch cushion, looking to steal your spare change*.\*\* So, again, I am looking for a cold wallet that can hold ALL coins. I use Binance for most of my alts (I'm sure that will change soon) and I am sick and tired of having 14 different wallets for each asset: some cold wallets, some desktop clients, some QT wallets, some paper wallets, some online wallets, the list goes on and on. Muy gracias
There is a chance to pump price today ?
5.9k and we start race to 12k.
its dead youre btc coin is dead..... you should go in alts invest in reddcoin
3 months ago I said it was going this low we're going to 5.5k 
Guys its over, NO REAL INTEREST OVER CRYPTO, hear me out xD

Maybe one day we will see again the green and green only :)
Now here's 20 minutes of powering up/yelling.
LOL 
lol
It's a good habit as long as you don't start to believe it yourself.
100k
ha.ha. nailed it bro. I hope we  don't need to do that I hope we can see a green light after this weeks. 

In what way? So more people can buy in, or the fact that it will be easier to mine now, if less profitable? I just got into Mining and I really want to know how cryptocurrency should be ideally and if I got in at the wrong time or not or if there's no such thing as a right time wrong time to get in.

I wonder why would the people in the future decide to give their wealth to the early adopters of bitcoin, instead of just adopting a cheaper currency that noone is holding large quantities of? Money is not wealth
Litterally everyone in the world will be millionaires! This will save humanity. I can't wait.
Expect the worst, hope for the best
I follow your optimism.   I’m on my last leg with you bud 
It’s not so bad really. Gives all of us a chance to buy more cheap coins.  You know it will go back up again someday and it will be a lot higher than today.  

‘Memba when bitcoin crashed?
‘Memba when it skyrocketed after?

Yeah I ‘Memba. 


Actually waiting for Consensus 2021, with special "performance" by John McAfee!
[LOL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zXDo4dL7SU)
Keep at it!  But once you get one, you just want to get to 2...
Just got to .75.  Cheap time for .25...
Congrats man! I started buying last August, at 1.68 now, should have 2 by this August
I hope you didn't invest more than you can afford to lose. This crazy experiment can go to $0. But I don't think it will. Enjoy the ride. When you're on a rocket it could explode st any second, or it could take you to the moon. 

Fundamentally Bitcoin is better than ever. Lightning is working. People are still coding more uses for Bitcoin. Halving is happening in less than two years. These are cheap coins. Anything under 10k are cheap. I thought I was crazy when I read the same number but under 1k. 

Crypto and not just crypto but Bitcoin is the future of all money. 
The irony of the situation is that the good fundamental news keep accumulating under the "surface" of the price.
I'm on paid vacations! :)
Im also mit sure if I should sell now before it drops ...

its over man, not like last 431 times , this time its very different

Better just wait for the next big dump
Said everybody that was about to die thinking they were about to be given a mansion in heaven. 
Will he eat it in a bun like hot dog or or sliced like salami on a pizza?
They call that trying to catch a falling knife.
Easy, buy every other dip.
 “These things have a way of working themselves out. I’m gonna let the liquor do the thinking.”
Tested and broke down... I don't see any volume from Bulls... bears in full control.
The people who bought at 15K are feeling like the world has ended...
45 min 
That is happening 30 times every hour.
I bought 6% of 1 today, is that enough??
Who is this in reference to?
The opposite is also true - that BS posts claiming that price will go to $xxx not only do not get banned, they get upvoted.

So the delusional level of this forum becomes self-perpetuating.
Reddit is completely full of bitches. That's why.
Banned.
I don't know if they are being removed but anything negative is getting downvoted which is bullshit.  I'm just going through upvoting anything that isn't spam.
Mods don't remove bad news. They remove repetitive posts, trolls, and those peddling scams and falsehoods. 

If you have something that needs looking at that automod removed incorrectly, then let us know. Automod isn't perfect.
Does it not hurt bad that they have lost 65-70% of their value since December? 
Moon Lambo ? #HODL
Lol at the way these articles are written. “The” Chinese government - source: Fintech Crypto News
Yeah it's crazy censorial in here. Have had some revealing 1-on-1s with a mod who basically said it was his duty to protect bitcoin from criticism. 
That's terrible. Mods need to grow up.
This forum is hardly moderated at all.  The moderators are very fair, perhaps too fair.
You mean /r/cryptocurrency. Sure /r/Bitcoin is heavily moderated but don't believe everything you read. That post is an obvious /r/btc hit job that is being massively brigaded right now. The whole thing is just an excuse for them to spew their blockstream propaganda and all circle jerk together. It's SO obvious what is happening there I'm amazed the mods there are just letting it happen. Bcashers are getting more desperate by the day as they realize their shitcoin is going nowhere.

Edit. Seems r/btc is not content just brigading /r/cryptocurrency today, now they are here too. And they wonder why this sub has to be heavily moderated.
There's no r/cc
You don't lose any money unless you sell. And you don't lose any btc unless you sell. The price will recover eventually.
People pretending to be traders :)

Hodl..


everyone should have at least 1 btc, let it crash, sell all your btc save 1, let others like me be able to buy 1, less greed is better
Yeah. Prepare to take a rocket in your moon.  Blast off!
Because they are a U.S Company and due to regulations they are forced to ask for these types of documents. 
They need to tax you for what you gain 
localbitcoins.com ?
Consider yourself lucky that you haven't bought.

By the look of it, 6.5k might not hold.  Better to wait.
Bullish
Lmao! On our way to mass adoption 
No, because everyone's got their $6k memes ready.
Well, the probability of a support zone to be broken increases each time it is tested.

This is the third time...
With a bullrun to new ath?
How much are you buying?  Are you buying whole coins or just fractions?  The reason why I ask is that I am trying to determine if the Odd Lot Theory is in full effect.
HODL = Holding On Despite Logic!!!
I crashed out
[deleted]
You're a fool to cash out (JMHO :
stoploss hunt + create panic
chinese new year
Public has lost interest, no new investors.
The price broke underneath the lower edge of a triangle it had been oscillating in for the last six months. Once that happened, the bots started selling like crazy. There's very little chance of it breaking above 7100 and staying there in the near future because there's going to be tons of short orders waiting for the retest.
Bitcoin is in a parabolic price movement (the downside). It happend a couple of times before. Bottom will be between 80%-90% of latest ATH. So start buying back in when prices hit between $2000-$3000.
Nice 
Seems like a sensible time to sell :p
Yes of course. Sell everything you have. 
im guessing they are making a adress for every customer?
This account appears to just go to different crypto subs and talk about how it’s going to crash.  Not sure what would motivate someone to do this but I hope it’s fulfilling for them. 
Wow you are really scared about those bags of Tether aren't you.

This. At Binance, 1st April low was at 6430. Todays low 6435. Nearly the same.
I ne'd.
Agreed the pain has been real for shortimers. I felt this way the end of last year sold out and watched it go to 20k. I'm experiencing similar feeling now. I have been buying dips to watch them loose % but I know i will regret the sale as I did last year so I sit and wait buy couple hundred worth every new dip and hope for the best. 
Short now?  

The thought cross my mind when it dropped to 6.5k but I think it's suicidal.

oh yeah, the consensus pump is coming soon, also soros pump, wait for it
That wasn't a bull.  It was Daisy the Cow.
Yeah whale pool channel said 5k by Saturday 
This
Yup
How can you tell? 
I don't think so, but I sure hope so...
pump to $9000
Sub $100?  That seems excessive.  What makes this cycle so much more bearish than previous cycles where the low of the bear market was above the high of the previous bull market?

You say this bubble is no different than previous bubbles, yet it's clear you think it's quite different from previous BTC bubbles.  Please explain.
You lost the plot when you took bitcoin to $800...

Moral of the story - don't get excited too quick
great statement! nailed it .

BS and hypocrite.  

You are just trying to get people to buy so that the price doesn't come crashing down.


Yawn
Who in their right mind thinks that it would only take 9 years for mass adoption and FIAT replacement?? Oh well, impatient crypto people I guess
Exactly, people need to start committing themselves to creating products using bitcoin that can provide value vs simply trying to buy in to cash out. 
how many stores in your town have you seen accept Bitcoin? -  
-> Media Frenzy in Japan as Bic Camera Starts Accepting Bitcoin
https://news.bitcoin.com/number-of-japanese-bitcoin-spenders-slowly-but-steadily-increasing-says-bic-camera/
That argument is getting really stale and old. I want to remind everybody that 6 months ago on the 12th of December, BTC was $20,000. 
So it can easily go back there now that FOMO and general interest has waned?
so you are saying it can test 2628 again, holy
Way too many lines, seriously. Give it some room ;)

[deleted]
Also watching the shorts increase the past few days. This is what we need for a nice little spike soon.
I do
yeah to read about the hack
If true, might be prompted by interest in spending Bitcoin in the world cup in Russia.
Buy the tasty tasty dips and HODL!!!!
.....
You feel better about your loss because your friend lost even more? Kudos.
He bought the dip!
Lol please shut up you bitch
Hahahah funniest comment of the day. 
no downvote for calling it, downvote for being a cock.
Well it's $6500 not $6k so you were wrong.
From now on I only do wut you do
I feel you I've been getting downvoted to for being right too
Along what your self esteem.

Bitcoin is a highlander :)
No, they did not kill BTC.

People just lost interest, simple as that.  No drama please.
Thanks for this post. Just bought more.
They haven’t won shit.  Just be patient. It will rise again soon enough. It always does. 
Don’t they expire today or tomorrow 
>slight corrections

heh
Correction is -10%.  Crash is -20%.

Bear is -20% for more than 2 months.

We are now more than -50% and more than 5 months.  
You won’t do it 
Well I hope you pick the right stocks and you make lots of lovely money and buy a nice home. 
If you ever want to buy BTC again, maybe just buy a little bit each week. Honestly, I don't think BTC should be used as a "get rich quick" scheme, although I realise that's not a popular opinion. I would actually suggest just putting a regular (modest and affordable) % of disposable income in for contingency's sake in the event the current economic climate goes to shit and the stocks disappoint. You never know. 
wait, did you really bet rent and life money on bitcoin?!
412th time it has  died 
Strange... Your post history shows you claiming the bottom was in two weeks ago when it was in the $7,500 range. 
Right after it hits 100k
I think not, currently it's on an unstoppable bear run.
Yes & No
5.89 and we star race to 11.99k
thats what they said at 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9 ,8,7,6k
3.2k soon
Reddcoin made the same dive as BTC.
There are no alts that move independently of BTC.
But thanks anyway.
You hopefully know that alts are over priced and that if BTC dies your alts go down with it
i think if bitcoin falls almost all coins follow. it is always the basis how the altcoins react in this market.

if bitcoin dies crypto dies lmfao 
Congrats man.  Life accomplishment 
Hindsight is 50/50
oh i expected it to go parabolic...you couldnt go 5 seconds without seeing a FOMO headline in the news, so it was prone to crash eventually, the real question was when, after the first "sharp" drop i actually couldn't see it going back up to that point but im happy with december gains, it was fun lol
many were insulted for speaking the same words. We are now laughing at those who insulted us!
Get you balls out of you inaginary wife's purse

Definitely within 3 years. 👍
You should try a Carolina Reaper ;)
Absolutely.  

And the hodlers will become the new lords of the world and will preside over governments and all the businesses.  They will become the new rent seekers and oppressors.  Same system, new faces.


This is not how the world works, inflation will make that million worthless since everyone will have it. 
No.  The majority of the world will only own a small fraction of a bitcoin.  We, the early adopter hodlers, will be the rich ones holding many millions of dollars of bitcoin each. 

It will be different from the current fiat system in many ways. One of my favorite ways is that the system itself cannot be tampered with.  Once the last of the 21 million coins is mined, no new bitcoin can magically be created like how fiat money is just printed at the will of government.  




That's all we can do. 
It's very hard to remain positive at the moment.  
Only like $1,700 at the current price.
Cool, my goal is to have at least a full BTC by the end of the year. Keep us posted when you achieve the 2 BTC.
What fucking fundamentals? It's purely being used (ok 99%) as a get rich quick scheme.

Most of the world hardly even uses credit card lmao. And you think crypto will be the currency of the near future? Not even in our children's life time will it be used widely. It's gonna be centuries .. and that's a big IF. 

Fundamentals lmao. Everyone I know just wants to BTFD and cash the fuck out with a quick 50-100% gain or whatever...

Only fools are hodling. If this bitch ran to 10k next week those "hodlers" would be the first to cash the hell out. 
wow. so nice of you!. such privilege you have. i hope i will have that someday haha. happy vacations bro!!

Best $40 I've ever spent
right ;)
What do you mean?  You think it’ll go lower?
Oh I know what they call this insanity
bulls are shy, they are in the background...
We found the whale.
Roger Ver I believe
Not sure I follow.
People get banned for posting just one thing. So strange. Not very open. 
Not as bad as one might think.
Still 6x year over year.... What's your point??? 
It’s not true. Period.
I mean ignoring the fact that 90% of people say otherwise just looking at your name how am I supposed to believe you?
This reads like a /r/The_Donald copypasta. The majority of the body of the post in question was entirely true, and happened as he said.
Oh. Damn I didn’t know. I’ve just seen so many threads and so many people in the last 6 months talk about how ridiculous the mods are on this sub, I always thought, just over exaggerating but after reading that last post and seeing yet again so much support from so many people saying similar things I was like WTF. Even vitalik and CEO of coinbase previously Brian Armstrong apparently called out r/Bitcoin mods for their retarded banning or something. I was like if this is who we elected as our mods for the biggest crypto by far on the biggest community, damn we fucked up horrible showcasing. Hope what you’re saying is true and these mods aren’t that crazy lo
r/cryptocurrency most likely
The minute you have bought BTC is the minute you lost your money. Why would the price recover? Bitcoin has been proven to be technically incapable to replace currency as a payment system. 
This is exactly why I still hodl my Enron stocks, they are going to fucking Mars soon and everyone who said otherwise will be sorry.
Whats the best place to buy bitcoin right now?
Lol .... down voted because I think 6.5 might not hold?  

You guys are in denial and it's not healthy.  Invest/speculate with your eyes open before you lose your pants.
nope, 5k locked and loaded.
It's inevitable even if it doesn't happen in 2018. 
Fractions. Trying to get my average costs down. As soon as we start to rally up, I will stop to buy.
tether is a scam
[deleted]
It's a volume induced drop. Without the volume we see another leg down.
They do and when the transaction shows in the Blockchain, they know you have sent the funds. 
What bags? Please explain. Is this some prediction that Tether is about to implode? I’ve been waiting for it!
why? wtf has that got to do with a random comment my wife gave this morning you weirdo lol
Let' s hope it reverses now
Just did.
No, i watched the last crash live on Binance and bottomed out at EXACTLY 6001

There was a TON of buy orders at that price.
No, don't short, now!  That's not what I wrote.  Short when you get adequate confirmation, by way of lower-highs and lower-lows, that it can't get through next resistence at 7500.  Short from that point.  Should it suddenly break above 7500, dump the short, immediately, and take the small loss.  If volume through 7500 is high, then go long with another buy on what we'll assume to be a rise to the next established resistance point.  This is never a pure science.  You're just betting the mostly likely odds by knowing the previous resistence or support points and watching for the heavy or light footprints which buyers and sellers leave in their wake.

Donald told me Daisy's a duck.
Man... Just been loosing money since months
[deleted]
I love how he reposted it like it was some amazing visionary post, lol
Have your alts crashed BTC4Trade ?

Heh.
GTFO here
every one has its own interest. this is the real world!

Your personal attacks simply bounce off me.  If you have been following my posts here for the last 5 months you should know I’m no hypocrite. I’m a huge fan of bitcoin and all that it offers. I also believe it will make me epically rich in 4-5 years. 
Wake up sleepy head and fight with us.  
this \^\^\^\^\^
Every business that had holdings in BTC lost 30% in the last three weeks
And housing prices were high in 2008. Speculative bubbles burst. Doesn't mean houses aren't great investments. Ever home that was bought and maintained at the peak of 2008 price is worth more today. 
No more tether printing?
not at all prompted about the big dump in price of crypto this weekend.
this is far from the dip .... sell and wait until $ 4000
yeah ! lucky for the rich they have so much leverage to buy right now.
Fuck yourself
Month hasn't ended
There is no being right when talking long term market movements.  There’s making wild guesses and getting lucky.
Bitcoin is not a bubble it is a financial revolution.
I have considered that as viable. If I can exchange crypto to pay all of my bills and do so without a significant tax burden then I see no reason why not.
I've been calling it since the very beginning. Thankfully I saw the signs and got completely out of Bitcoin in mid February. Bitcoin has 0 chance of reaching 9k ever again. Too many variables keeping it this way. Sorry if truth hurts but I've been warning people for past months now and unfortunately no one listens.
I hope you are joking. They are not done bringing Bitcoin down. Once it has reached an acceptable price (hearing 2-3k according to one of my inside sources) it will trade mostly sideways forever.
Not this time. You underestimate the influence of people like George Soros, Jamie Dimon and Bill Gates. They are part of an elite society that goes back hundreds of years and that has shaped and influenced many Nations and many world events. You think any of you have a chance??? I care about you. I care about everyone here. This is going to get ugly very soon. It's time to realize this.

If people listened to me back when I was making my warnings they would be in a better place now. It is foolish to go down with the ship when I show you the life boats.
yes
Actually, BTC crashes in the past have been much greater than 20%. Quit applying normie TA to Bitcoin. 
You're right
Lol nah, that was sarcasm. Just hurts to see the price play these games.
And two weeks from now he'll be saying $5500 is bottom, buy now!
sweet dream
who are they? May I know their names? 
I put all my money in tether.   IM GONNA BE RICH.
you mean 20/20 lol
It ain’t over til it’s over, Homes.
Well well well :)

Glad i have own brain which i can use :P
So you think the current early adopter who just got in the market this year and are now seeing prices they can afford, should own 5 coins? 
Rent seeker and hypocrite.
I’ve been thinking it might be a good idea for a lot of us to take a break from watching the price and subs constantly for a few months.  It can be toxic in here around these times.  The fudsters and nocoiners come out of the woodwork in full force to try to bring down morale.  

Best strategy is to go out and enjoy life and keep buying the coins when you can.  Don’t worry, it will get better.  Too much money and brainpower has gone into bitcoin and the entire cryptocurrency movement. 


I guess Venezuela using Bitcoin to hedge against inflationary practices just isn't good "fundamentals" then. 
Enjoy them when you get there!
Rip bitcoin
Yes, the bad news and low volume will probably make it a dump week. 
“You know what a shit barometer is? It measures the shit pressure in the air. You can feel it. Listen, Bubs. Hear that? Sounds of the whispering winds of shit.”
They're waiting for $100
Of the sub
I've been exposed!
That's stretching the truth a bit.

If you come in here shilling an altcoin, making threats, or spreading outright lies/trolling, or  your entire post history is altcoin spam, yes, a ban can occur. We will often reverse them after 30-60 days if you ask nicely. 


I guess I don't know your situation, you might be a multi millionaire and therefore it does not hurt that much. 
Last friday it was 7x year over year. 2 weeks before that it was 8x year over year...
I think my question is very self explanatory.  No one can tell me that they are not hurting bad since the Dec ATH even if they are still millions ahead.  This has been a horrid 6 months.


6 months ago people were saying

>still 10x year over year...whats your point???

3 months ago people were saying

>still 8x year over year...whats your point??

hmmm wonder what theyll be saying 6 months from now...
If you actually looked over this forum you would see for yourself, have a good day. 
I never said /r/Bitcoin wasnt heavily moderated. What I'm saying is that the entire post was a planned hit job so /r/btc shills have somewhere to cry about censorship and how Blockstream is the illumunati. It's pretty obvious that whole post is heavily brigaded.
Brian Armstrong and Vitalik both have their own agendas. They trash Bitcoin because they are trying to push their on shitcoins.
Technically incapable is a little too strong.

More like inferior and obsolete
Proven? Links plox
Right but there's a huge difference between bitcoin and a defunct fraudulent company.
I buy from Coinbase gdax and Gemini.  All require ID 
[you could give Bisq a try](https://bitcoin.org/en/exchanges)
In the US you can use Gemini and Coinbase but you are going to have to provide your ID to get verified and be able to buy bitcoin. The verification process takes like 2 weeks to 2 months on these exchanges so if you do not want to wait that long buy it on Localbitcoins with several payment methods.
You were probably downvoted for giving unsolicited advice/opinion instead of answering a concrete and clear question. 
Inevitable?  

If there is one thing true about BTC is that anything can happen so nothing is "inevitable".
Same
I downvote because I would never cash out.
So then they have to manage lots and lots of addresses, and if they mess up they loose any funds for addresses that they loose. So another company comes along and offers to handle all that for them, and cover any losses, and charge some amount for the service, and the retailer says thanks and uses the service. Hmmm, what shall we call that sort of company .... I know, we'll call it a "Bank".

Don't get me wrong, I think Bitcoin and block chain are great, and the potential to transfer funds without third parties is great, but day to day stuff will move most transactions into the remit of what will be, effectively, banks.
Yes
The other Daisy ..... responsible for global warming, no less.

Okay....but that doesn't answer the question.  What makes this cycle different?  BTC wasn't used for taxes in 2013-2015 either, and yet the market crash still found a bottom above the previous highs.

BTC is more widely known and understood than in the previous cycle.  The service providers are more robust and reputable (on average).  Institutional custodial services are now available.  Lightning is available.  I see many reasons why the fundamentals are better than in the previous cycle, but I don't understand how you see BTC's market cap heading below $1.7B.  

A protocol that stores and transfers value in a censorship-resistant manner has some value, regardless of whether it's used to pay taxes.  Why is that value now less than $1.7B when in the bleakest depths of the last cycle the participants thought its value was greater than that?
Stop influencing people to lose more money.

As of now, everyone who bought above 7.5k is a long term bag carrier.  
Hypocrite and rent seeker.

Yes, I have glanced through your posts and it simply reinforces what I said.
I’m pretty happy with our current financial system 
You can't live in a bitcoin timmy
It's a factor, but most people who weren't following Bitcoin before the dump have forgotten about it. Whereas the world cup begins in two days where Bitcoin would actually be relevant to people who don't normally follow markets.
I’m concerned about your sodium intake.  Try drinking more water.
Maybe people don't listen to a complete tool that comes with random bullshit. No facts or whatsoever. Now back to your iceposeidon streams lil fanboy
Come on ..... no drama.

People here are so reactive.
Are you comedian 1 or 2?
cheers for that panic post, bought another dip xD
Difference is when bitcoin sinks it miraculously rises from the depths every single time.  I don’t care how much power Soros, Dimon, and Gates have. They cannot stop a decentralized platform like bitcoin.  As long as we stubborn holders keep buying up the cheap coins, the power transfers from them to us, bitcoin by bitcoin.  We’re the good guys who want a brighter future through the blockchain. They’re the bad guys trying to stop the inevitable to preserve their power and wealth.  They will lose in time.  They should jump onboard with us and be winners.  Mark my words within 3 years bitcoin will be at least 100k each. 
Doesn't change the definition of what constitutes a correction, crash and bear.

Stop trying to put lipstick on a pig by changing terminology.
this reddit
Nope I mean 50/50
People who bought this year are not "early adopters".

Early are those who bought way back before 2013, slightly late are those who bought before 2017.  

After Dec 2017, all buyers are already bag holders unless you can find an opening to cut your losses and exit.
why do you think we are the early adopters? the early adopters were in the 1$ range, we might aswell be the greater fools in the end
You should buy as many coins as you can comfortably afford.  IMO Just a matter of time before the market moons again.  
Wow.  How lucky am I to have my very own troll?  I shall be ignoring you now. 
They resort to that because their country/economy is fundamentally in shambles.....
But that's not actually happening, so the point is mute.
as am i, i'll buy 10 then and hold them for 10 years.
I hear ya. Not trying to shill or anything. I follow this subreddit but never post. I read Cryptocurrency subreddit more. Either way not trying to fire anyone up.
What's self explanatory is your childish notion that looking at a charts past is somehow indicative of a person's self loathing of what could have been. No real trader, bitcoin enthusiast, or stable genius lowers themselves to traits of a gambling addicted day trader that is emotional and unstable. I bought and mined 90% of my coins even before this run up last year,  I have bought the other 10% in the last 6 months on every dip. I could not be happier I have another chance to buy below 10k(and would be happy even if it goes all the way down to 1500 or lower). You should re-evaluate yourself and your life if you are always negatively living in the past like that. 
Sometimes, it is better to be on the better side of history, kid. It may not be 6 months from now, may be six years, But I promise my comment will age a lot better than yours. Good luck in your shorting travels. See you at 1500, then see you at 50,000. Welcome to the future. 
Armstrong is in trouble. This investigation by the Feds is for him and Ver and the December shit move they pulled. Inside info. The investigation is not about bitcoin manipulation but Ver’s bait and switch on the bitcoin.com site and Armstrong adding Bcash randomly without warning and allowed it to be traded at $7k to certain individuals. It added confusion to market and bitcoin began its downward trend. Setting it back a year. This administration is big on bitcoin. 
Imagine all payments worldwide were to be done with BTC, yes Bitcoin is technically incapable. 
In other words don't look at the fundamentals or you may see something you won't like.
My coinbase verification was instant.  I was buying in minutes.  Just sharing my experience. 
OMG, that's way longer than a bank, are you guys sure this is going to rock the world? 
My bad.
If anything can happen, as T approaches Infinity, it will will happen.

addresses dont mess up, its hard coded. Addresses are generate by hashing a public key, with ripemd160 hash after a sha256 hash on the public key. A company offering to manage addresses would get laughed at and it would be an obvious scam. I dont understand why you would think bitcoin and/or blockchain is great if you didnt understand that, because if unique, accurate addresses couldn't be formed, then there is no point for either.
Stop projecting. If you want this lower, make it happen doughboy.
You are obviously on the opposing side of this war and the wrong side of history. I urge you to reconsider your position and join us or please GTFO of the way!
Like in the matrix, ignorance is bliss. Stop taking the blue pill and open your eyes. 
You will see just like many others have already. You think you or anyone else can beat them? This will only end in tears for all of you. 🙂
No, we are not the good guys.

We are just another group of rent seekers hoping to get rich without contributing anything.
Ok I'm willing to take a bet that in 3 years bitcoin will be lower than 100k

how much are you willing to lose? 
yes, but this might be right, look at the wall street cheat sheet, it look like we are about to bottom out and are in depression phase. we need just to go a little lower (i hope for 5k to load heavy my slaughtered bags)
Should have listen to your mother and stop taking advice from strangers with questionable usernames over the internet.


So you suggest we sell if had 5? It saying if had 5, you’ll be one on off the millionaires the next generation sees. 
Misery loves company :)
Keep holding the bag.  You can carry it to your 'menial' workplace (your words, not mine).
And why is that? 
ah yes, the "one day in future ill be right so theres no possible way to argue me with now" argument. Have fun losing money for the foreseable future.
This is why I was confused when Coinbase announced their intention to be a SEC approved exchange. Like how in hell would they get approved for that after the bcash insider trading scandal? I also thought it was strange that Coinbase held on to everyones fork coins for six months as to not allow their customers to dump their bcash and crash the price. I hope they fry his ass. 
I have no idea what your talking about, the fundamentals have never been better.
Verification takes about 15 minutes.  
Ok, I can't win against this technicality :)
A lot of philosophers on these boards ..

We all have our individual circumstances.  And non-committal IMO is equally risky.
Sure, unique addresses are easy to create, and bitcoin is easily transferred to that (public) address. But i someone (or a company) "forgets" or looses the private key, then they can no longer access the bitcoin stored at that address (think that guys hard drive in the landfill). So retailers are going to say, bitcoin fine, but we don't want to manage all those addresses ourselves, we want someone to do it for us, and we want them to cover any losses. And then a company (which may as well be known as a "Bank") will offer that service, and the retailers will go for it, just as they use Banks now.
I frankly don't give a shit if it goes lower or higher.

Just don't come pretending to represent a higher cause when all you are doing is trying to rent seek.
[removed]
Speak for yourself.  I use bitcoin as a currency and will continue to do so as opportunities to use it expand. 
I literally have zero money to bet anyone since all my disposable income is already in bitcoin.   That’s how certain I am that we will reach 100k within 3 years.  The halvening will help us get there. 
That cheat sheet has been a crystal ball so far lol
If that's what you think, then hodl.  

Just make sure you can afford to lose everything if things continue to go south.
Google is your friend.
I admitted we will go to 1500... I can assure that will happen, to scare the little fruit loops, which I venture you may closely self identify. But am I losing money if I bought most before 2013???? Unlike you, this isn't my pyramid scheme, this isn't my buy high sell low. This is THE future. Get it now or get in later, it will be what takes over. May be worth 50k a coin, may be worth 5 a coin..... stop pretending like monetary value is everyone's only incentive. I look forward to returning to this comment in 6 months and hopefully you haven't deleted your account. 
Number 1 RULE which no one obeys:  not your keys, not your coins. 

Armstrong and Ver are in trouble. Bitcoin is fine. I love this discount. Didn’t realize how scared the US investor is. The technology is right there that is going to change the world. People like Armstrong and Ver need to be made examples of to not take advantage of their positions and trust that people who disobey the # 1 rule. 

It’s ashame abs demonstrates how bad hard forks are. Ver could have been patient and worked with consensus. Now the state department is starting to get him to the U.S. via japan embassy. He can hate America all he wants like he says but you can’t break American law and not be accountable. 

No 8/1/17 hardfork to create Bcash and no confusion and more unity. Adoption would have continued to increase but him and Armstrong went the illegal way and will be charged. 
The price is decoupled from fundamentals. If it weren't surely it should rise instead of fall? The fundamentals have never been better? It's purely speculative.

Right... Tell me, if suddenly there were a new wave of people interested in bitcoin and the number of transactions will rise again from 160k to let's say 500k due to popularity, what will be the average fee?

It looks like fundamentals are practically the same as they were in January, LN is not ready for usage, it's still being tested and it is not recommended to use the mainnet right now unless someone is okay with fucking up and losing funds. If bitcoin had the same demand it had 6 months ago today the fees would skyrocket again.


[deleted]
Perhaps there may be a company that would be hold encrypted private keys, but I dont see why anyone would use a bitcoin bank to issue and receive payments while taking a percentage, because you can send and receive yourself easily and as long as you have various backups then you're safe. You dont need to manage addresses yourself, they're automatically generated. 
Ahh, it sounds like you're one of the emo traders. Good riddance. Don't worry about me, I know what I'm doing.
Speaks a man who has clearly lost a fortune trying to trade in alts, then comes back to the BTC fold in panic and indignation, and attempts to take the mantle of some wise old man.

Grow up.
Here is one definition of:

“Rent-seeking is an individual's or entity's use of company, organizational or individual resources to obtain economic gain without reciprocating any benefits to society through wealth creation. An example of rent-seeking is when a company lobbies the government for loan subsidies, grants or tariff protection.”

Wrong. Besides material pursuits, my primary desire for becoming rich is so that I don’t have to work my menial day job anymore.  My true passion is physics and invention and if I were able to devote my entire day to that instead of a bullshit desk job, i believe I could contribute far more to the world and maybe if I’m smart and lucky enough generate more wealth and prosperity into the world than I individually consume. 

You have no clue about me. So stop it. 
it's the typical something for nothing attitude. it'll all work out in the end. don't sweat these clowns BTC4
You just contradicted yourself without realising it.

Hypocrite.
Good luck then. Hope it turns out okay. 

Remember to only invest in BTC what you can afford to lose, because there is a very high probability it's going to be worthless when the FED Releases a dollarcoin linked to the $USD

Anybody who thinks that governments and big corpo/banks are going to give away their power of control is delusional. 
You were missing my point. 
Take it easy.
In a word, liability (or, more colloquially, papering over your arse) (or ass if you are American). Companies will pay to offload responsibility to someone else, especially if that someone else offers guarantees. Also, addresses may be automatically generated, but you would still need to keep track of them, for instance for auditing. Again, companies will offload it, and "banks" will provide the service.

What makes you think I'm worried about you?

Moron.
I miss Bitcoin of four to five years ago when we all knew it was going to 100k or higher if it succeeds with its promises. But that wasn't the reason we were all in (not to be confused with all-in) Bitcoin. The reason was because we wanted a currency that anyone could use and not debase on a whim like the Fed does via QE. Getting rich wasn't the goal. It was the outcome. 

Now shitstorms like this convo happen on the daily because people are losing lots of money. I held from 1100 to 200 and back to 20,000. These people don't have a clue! 
Rent seeker and a hypocrite.
?
So are you. There's a lot of things that were rotten from the core with this country...

Leadership/political being the key driver..
Ahh, a narcissist. Like I said, good riddance.
I came for the potential riches too, not having a clue about the tech.  Then I actually took the time to educate myself on the tech and I love it and what it stands for.  To me it is about freedom, in many ways, not just for myself but for all of us. 

That’s why I fight. 
I asked you to stop. I even took the time to prove you wrong, yet you persisted. I have reported you to the mods. You are obviously up to no good here. 
Go read up what rent seeking means.

Then tell me what is your contribution so that, to quote "I also believe it will make me epically rich in 4-5 years".

When you do, you will understand why I said you are contradicting yourself.
Public interest is gone, regulators are clamping down, exchanges are getting hacked, price has crumbled since Dec with no end in sight.

Anyone who's still encouraging others to buy is a dick.  And probably also a loser holding a bag and hoping there will be new buyers to take his shit bag.
You just proved me right.

If you were genuine in wanting BTC to succeed, it will be to encourage people to use and spend BTC, not speculate in its price and hoping to get rich by doing nothing.

You obviously are clueless that the two goals are incompatible - a volatile price and acceptance as a currency.

So yes, I stand by what I say - You are a hypocrite and a rent seeker.
By holding bitcoin you help the entire ecosystem.  It also allows you to save capital to deploy it at a later date... 
Why don't you just bugger off?
In my opinion it will not fully catch on as a currency until more people buy it. We need millions and millions to buy, hold and spend it. Not sell it.   So the price must go up first. 

I am not wasting anymore time with you on this point.  I’m genuine. I don’t need your validation.  
To discourage more people from losing their money.

Aren't the reasons I stated true?  Feel free to correct me if it's wrong.
Rubbish.

Every single BTC is already owned by someone (or lost).  

Buying/selling BTC by itself is called speculation and does nothing but creates price volatility.

You have just validated to everyone reading this is that you are a hypocrite and a rent seeker.  Ever occured to you that you are doing a menial job because that's what you are really worth and nothing more?
