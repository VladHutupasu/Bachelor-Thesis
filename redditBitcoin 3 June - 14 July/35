Daily Discussion, June 10, 2018 -- TITLE
what if the real bullrun was all the friendships we made?
Being homeless won’t be so bad
You can be “in it for the tech” but you definitely can’t say you like losing money 
6 months of bleeding to death.
just the way she goes boys, friggin way she goes....

fundus are safu
There is so much movement in the background that we don't see on the public trades markets. This market is gonna take off eventually. It seems inevitable 
There goes all gains since Nov.
Lol, I go take a shower and price has dropped $400 when I come back
Apparently the flash\-crash was caused by a hack of Coinrail in S. Korea. Again and again exchanges will be hacked. And when the Bank of America starts accepting crypto, its cryptos will be stolen too, again and again. In other words, banks get robbed because that's where the money is. Only when enough goods and services are available for cryptos and not fiat will people not need crypto exchanges. It is the fiat\-crypto interface that will always be risky. When [Augur.net](https://Augur.net) gets up and running, you can just make bets on whether a major crypto hack will take place by a certain date and time. If you make the time far enough into the future, you will make money if anyone accepts the bet. Which they won't. 
The owners of lambo dealers must be pissed.
**Can you feel it now Mr. Krabs?**
If they ever tell my story, let them say that I walked with giants.
Ideas rise and fall like the winter wheat, but these ideas will never die.
Let them say I lived in the time of Steve Jobs tamer of complexity.
Let them say I lived in the time of BITCOIN.
Im just thinking about this this Dutch guy who sold his house, kids toys, bought bitcoins and move with the family in a caravan. He might be rich in x-years, but I'm highly doubtfull he's living a nice live atm. The emotional rollercoaster must be immense.
Daily hopium:

“People think they're ready for the drops because they've seen them in the price history. Then they get 5 months of bad news, and they're ready to abandon ship. We've heard many, many calls for the death of bitcoin, and the ecosystem didn't have 1/10th the capability it has now.

The price dropped from $38 to $2 for a reason: people thought they would be totally worthless. The price dropped from $250 to $90 because people thought it would be totally worthless. Now people are realizing again, "hey it really could be totally worthless". Same type of people get shaken out each time - weak hands.

It ain't a sure thing, but the stakes are huge. If you bought in at $1000, I'm sorry for your paper losses. But if there's a 10% chance this thing could have the market cap of gold, it's worth the risk to me to keep a small portion of my assets in the protocol.

I believe in the mission, I believe in the math, and I believe in the ecosystem. And it's been one hell of a ride. I'm not getting off now just because some bureaucrat in China farted.”

Don't worry guys, must be because of chinese people selling preparing for summer vacation.
This sub is seriously terrifying. It's pretty much r/incels except with money instead of sex. 

Learn something before investing. Memes aren't going to make the margin calls stop.
Wheeeeeeeeeee!
How dip is your love, HODLers?
[removed]
Everything was pointing towards a breakout... Just not this way :/.
Well if this the rate of drop we maybe at 5000 today lol
Someone dumping big, price keeps trying to recover and then drops another 50 dollars on like a 100 coin market sell. 
Had a limit order to buy BTC at 7000.....i want to pull my hairs out....
**This is good for bitcoin!**
Bought me another coin. Thanks guys for the pull back! :)
Any comment from John Macafee?
No matter what, please know there is always a way out from addiction. You can still recover. 
Next major breakdown in the Bitcoin chart could be coming next week.

[https://www.tradingview.com/x/k9FRRPFG/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/k9FRRPFG/)
I purchased my first BTC when it around $14 (invested a few hundred). Didn't really know what I was doing, but it pretty much turned out to be a total loss and I lost *a lot* thanks to mtgox and my own haphazard storage of my currency.

Go figure, I had some extra money and despite the fact that I'm totally out of the loop on the goings on, I bought some BTC less than 24 hours before this dip. 

Any thoughts - realistic, optimistic, pessimistic - are welcome. I understand that these fluctuations are par for course, but Jesus Christ I've had bad luck with this "investment". 
haven't kept up with crypto in awhile. Is the bloodbath today in response to some news?
Goldman Sachs has announced their intent to launch a cryptocurrency trading desk as well, a move which is likely to be followed by other banks. A few countries around the world have announced they’re working on crypto regulations and a few have already come out with a clear stance.

Buy the dip :D
I give up....good luck to everyone. 
damn tempted to buy more 

Fuckin crypto. Should’ve sold in December... oh well. 
Im going all in. 
So glad I spent 10mbtc on drugs two weeks ago when the price was much better. Saved like 20%. Thanks bitcoin!
early adopters they said
Hi,

Can anyone please help me on this?

Either this is way too good, or way too bad.. we're in the final moment fellas.
Don’t have finger left to catch the falling knife and BTFD :-( During the weekend SEPA payement doesn’t come to the exchange, I hope it will no go up by the time my payement get to my exchange account :-( 

Lesson learned, I should always have a small amount of Fiat waiting on the sideline for crazy dip in value. In another way, if it dip any further I’ll get some sweeter deal on Monday :-)

I am still bearish...
Is a 1k investment anytime soon sane right now? Or should I buy in fragments?
Guessing those coinrail hackers are dumping at any price
I thought the world cup was the perfect time for a BTC spike that guy is eating his own poop now.
Bloodbath

People are just cashing out for Father's Day gifts. It will bounce right back after the 17th with all the dad's money flowing in.
Somebody has to be responsible for my losses, this is getting ridiculous someone has to be held accountable.  I’m writing Donald Trump going straight to the top.  
volume is too low for this downtrend just like the previous one, bullish signal imo

https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/historical-data/
Volume been around 3-4k for the past few days and someone knew they could manipulate the price down easily based on the low volume. Over 4.4k btc sold in less than an hour at market. Will recover.
I might not have the lambo but if I cash out now I can get some rims.
bitcoin something something moon something something
Right - don’t panic - get some whisky, drink it, send GF to lesbian bar and HODL.
Daily Hopium (part 2):


Being a fudster/nocoiner is an ageless pastime...


“If you invested 140k and have 770 btc then you bought them for $182 each and today the price is $380, over double your money. No wonder you aren't panicking yet. How about these people who bought at $600, $700, $800 and up? Lets see how cool you are when it hits $50 and all your gains turn into massive losses.”

https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/22qc1d/comment/cgpcc16

Don’t worry, we have strong support line at 1800$.
holy shit whats happening
rebuying tomorrow if it stays like this. 
If you dont think about it then this is good for bitcoin
I just need to quit checking.  It’s messing with my overall psyche

I have my funds in a hardware wallet safely locked away.

However, I also want to have/use a hot wallet paired to my mobile phone so I can also *spend* instead of just hodl. I don't trust non-hardware wallet solutions, yet I am willing to accept a lower security since it's a hot wallet.

What is the safest/most user friendly option out there for me? Are there more than average risks involved with having a mobile wallet as opposed to a desktop one? 
I would prefer to use a hardware wallet on my hot wallet too, but consider them to be too expensive for the use-case so I am open to hearing other suggestions.
Bought a KeepKey hardware wallet.  Is this a good option for a 5+ year hodl? 
That is it, we need this high volume to confirm we are at the bottom. Let take a look at the last bottom at 6k and 6k4, all have massive volume, especially high volume at some moment like this.
Well, that sucks. But I'm buying some more anyway, as soon as I see a new bottom forming...
why is it falling so fast now?
Falling faster and faster! RIP hodlers!
Time for some Prozac...
just hodl where do you think its gonna go

DCA = $6500. If it goes below that then I can lower it with more BTFDs. Joy.

Sharp drop is better than slowly bleeding out. It will bounce back again and again.
Had been wanting to sell everything since about 5/5 to stop having to check 197 times a day and reduce daily stress levels. 

Finally did it on a whim yesterday and could feel my blood pressure and heart rate all thanking me. 

Very tempted to go back in again. 
That is what I did. I only bought $100, but that is enough to for me combat the need to panic sell.
You guys realize the high volume is because bitcoins are losing their value faster and faster right?
Looks like HODLers are getting ready to MOON!  
Don't forget to spread your cheeks...

I am normally a bitcoin bull, but this price action over the past couple of months is very concerning for me. I am on the sideline in cash right now. We breached a major level of 7300 and 7000 is in sight where below things could get very ugly. I believe in higher prices down the road but why sit though the pain right now when you could pickup btc at lower prices of around 3-5K where ALL the weak hands get shaken out. Things look dangerous on a technical level right now. I am preserving my capital for clear signs of bottoming.
Whose gonna regret not buying 
The only good thing about such a volatile market is that if it can drop more than 10% in a single day, it can also rise by that much in a day. 
Why the fuck isnt this trash going up? How much longer do we have to wait until some fucking retards fomo and drive the price up so we can get rich QUICK. Fuck the tech i want money
7150! look at bitcoin go! we're gonna make it my friends!
**Come On Bulls, we have to defend $7k!**
it seems ton vays was pretty close right when he said about the price prediction to Doug Polk in his podcast
Everybody panic! 
It's starting to bounce. 😊
This is just sad. Is there ANY good news to look forward to? Every time we get head something happens lol. 
Even if it falls to 5.5k, Bitcoin is still almost doubled since this date last year. 
**Support the Bears!**
Fire sale get it while its cheap. The bogdanoffs called in the Korea FUD.
Has the jerkoff Asian whale got it out of his system yet?   

Still not selling biatch.  
Can we get 5k Bitcoin this week?.
hi. when moon.
Lmao at all those who were proud of going "long" at 7.5k
Now i'm only hopping the price dont bounce too fast till my funds are arrived on the exchange so i could buy more.
I love sales
I said a month ago this investigation was coming. It is not about bitcoin. It’s roger Ver located in Japan. My wife works for the subcommittee that is working with the state department to get him to America via U.S. Marshalls who on ready to go when Japan embassy says it’s a go. They had to make it public before they charge roger Ver. Coinbase and roger Ver in December negotiated an addition of Bcash to coinbase in the middle of the night which added confusion and started the downward tread. Everyone who sees bitcoin this low, jump on board cause bitcoin is not being investigated, roger is. Bitcoin is at a discount now. I’m posting on this “daily tread” cause Reddit erases it at midnight and I won’t get in trouble spilling government goal. Roger is done. Anyone who followed my advice saved up for this drop. 
Just buy a little more. Take your chances guys. 

Better to buy at 6.8k than 20k.

I'm trying to start accepting Bitcoin for my small business... What's the easiest way of setting the price? Let's say I have a 3000JPY product; would I just convert that to BTC each time a customer asks to purchase it? Is there a more efficient way of doing this?
[deleted]
Higher volume AND  a price discount!? It's a good day! 
To those who refused to believe we would never go bellow 7K again, I hope you are having a wonderful day :)
Market is dying. It just is. 
Omg, what a sale we were all blessed with today! Buy buy buy!!!
fyi we're going to 5k.  been warning yall.  6k will be the new high by end of june\-july.  each month the new high is 1k lower.
This is f*ckin BS, limited supply and demand from 100’s of exchanges to trade going up and up by the day , how the f*ck is the price going down
Bloody red turds are dropping, open your mouth and say ahhhhhh.
So, bitcoin die first, or early adopters die first?
HODL!!!
Hmmm buy more... FOMO is a bitch

Already 'in deep'

Don't really buy into the don't spend more than you afford to lose

If it moons.... whether it be in 2 weeks/months/years I firmly believe new ATH will happen

Tea leaves of course
This has to be the time big money will dive in.  
They say we won't see 10k this year yall.

Let me see i can call it this time i say 3500$ bitcoin.

My only regret is that I have no money left at the moment to buy the third dip of the triple bottom.
great dip, i love it
Highest price predictions for the rest of 2018.....I will go for $11,000
This is the best thing that can happen...the faster this shit goes to hell, the sooner it will start rising again like in 2015-2016.
It’s funny how all these so-called hacks happen when it seems people are trying to Drive the market back down.  Just needed one last push to get back into the 6000 range so the big boys can buy back again Before popping it back up. Rinse/repeat
A mayor Korean (coinrail) exchange was hacked yesterday.
what are the chances that bitcoin reaches 10k again? not that i'll be rich, i only have like $50 worth of bitcoins
Is everyone on this reddit just a complete amateur? I'v only started learning about crypto TA when the crash happened but I could tell you right now this bear break out was seen coming, and its best for the market right now.
If Bitcoin and the rest of the cryptocurrency rally is on the rails of another few weeks of the bears because the recent rally didn't have enough volume behind, then why doesn't everyone on Reddit just agree to start trading?... Am I missing something? Will that not work/is it illegal?

Edit:

Not a pump and dumper!  Just trying to understand market psychology, as well as what is and is not allowed (or considered ethical) in cryptocurrency trading.  I am new to all of this and am only trying to learn.  Any advice/input is greatly appreciated :)   
Yeeeesss. Let it fall fall fall
7k by 12pm EST   9k by June 18th.  That’s as far as I’ll reach

This will be the last time to buy bitcoin under $7000. Mark my words.
Lame.
Something is up with BANCOR. Its vol has 10 to 100X on many cryptos. It is throwing everything for a loop. I wonder if it was hacked. Just look at the top 50 cryptos right now \- most all are BANCOR exchanged . Does anyone else see this.....

Yes nothing validates more than anonymous internet friendships. The only downside to that is...whales are not only accumulating more and more Bitcoin but they’ve also developed life-lasting friendships as well. And not just internet friendships but real life friendships. Not trying to be a Debbie Downer but the only bull run we’ll be making is a Red Bull run to the grocery store to counter the massive fatigue we all be experiencing.
Aye 
Indeed, that was the real treasure we all were looking for this whole time. Where's Nicholas Cage? 
As long as you hold your private keys.
If you aren't gambling more than you can afford to lose and have a steady job it's easy to buy the dips over the bear runs and come out amazingly ahead on the bull runs over years. You call it losing money I call it time to buy.
I believe in the tech so I'm "donating my money".... I quietly whisper through my tears in the dead of night
Agreed.
investing means you take thee risk of loosing what you invest....I think, this is the time to invest.
story of my life

Sometimes she goes, sometimes she doesn't.  Way she goes. 
Frig off iamdop
Exactly. All for nothing. I would have been better with stocks.
Please never take a shower again.
but the repo man is happy :(
He's a retard to drag his family into this shit.
He bought at like 2 or 3k so even if this shit goes to 4k he's probably still up 100k+.

If you watch the video they say they are prepared to lose everything because they want to live a simple lifestyle anyways. And to be honest, There is something to be said for raising a family in a simplistic outdoor lifestyle than a standard western lifestyle where they will end up with terrible back and wrist problems from instagram or gaming addictions.


> The price dropped from $38 to $2 for a reason: people thought they would be totally worthless. The price dropped from $250 to $90 because people thought it would be totally worthless. Now people are realizing again, "hey it really could be totally worthless". Same type of people get shaken out each time - weak hands.

Well, the problem now is, the cycle has repeated enough times to become predictable, which makes it a problem. If it can be predicted, then it is open to be exploited.


Edit:

>  But if there's a 10% chance this thing could have the market cap of gold, it's worth the risk to me to keep a small portion of my assets in the protocol.

Gold has an advantage. To make it work as a currency, it does not need to be continuously mined. Once it is mined and minted as coins, you can shutdown the mining operations and still use it as a currency. With Bitcoin, you cannot do this. Bitcoin needs mining to be constantly working. 
+1 
Just plain, simple, ordinary hysteria fueling a market move. Business as usual. Every time this happens it's "but this time it's different". Over and over and over again. I'll just stick with the IDGAF approach. 
it's funny because they never bought again after they sold before the chinese new year
Don't believe everything, most of these people are trolls.
You must be a big idiot if you bought bitcoins on a margin. Who does that in such a volatile market?
LOL us winners don’t whine, you are just seeing the loud retards
you'll need patience if your HODLING in a BIG DIP
The first time was ugly, now is just another chance to buy more Bitcoin. 
Hmm... tempting.. if u bring the whiskey, pizza and whores then maaaybe... 
[deleted]
nothing was pointing to a break out. wtf were you looking at?
If it get to 5k I’ll consider becoming a wholecoiner. 4k and i’ll be definitely doing it :-p depending on the steepness of the fall I might be doing it finger by finger as the knife fall to optimize a tiny bit.

Waiting on the sideline (but HODLING what I already have)

(Talking in EUR)
Hope so.
Sell limit orders. Mine was at 7200. 
Haven’t seen one today.  But he probably wouldn’t since it’s just a short term price fluctuation.     

Guys this is short term, by some whale(s) determined to bring down the price. 


I say FUCK EM!  I’m going to continue to buy and hold.   This will pass and bitcoin will rebound soon. 
Please give advice, I really don't know how. When you make $1000 on an airdrop for 5 seconds of work, or live through an insane bull market where every single coin that shouldn't exist, yet does exist does a x10, how do you break that addiction? :c

I take profits obviously, but I sometimes still kick myself when the price goes up and I sold. Although it's times like this that i'm happy that I took some profits while in the green. It feels like a neverending marry-go-round really. I've lost a couple of thousand here and there, but it's never really affected my bottom line
How did you manage to overcome yours? 
Those lines are weird. That top line has already been broken on my chart.
Don't think of it as a 24 hour investment, more like a 24 month investment. 

It goes up and down, if it goes up, feels like you should have bought more, of it goes down, ya should have bought less.

Welcome  back to the chaos club

I've been buying 500$ weekly since February, and tomorrow will continue to do so until the end of the year.  I believe in Bitcoin and I'm looking forward to my 2-5 year returns, as opposed to weekly returns.
The market can remain irrational for longer than you can remain solvent.
do you believe it will be a success in the future? If so, would you prefer knowing about it now, and being unlucky, or would you prefer to be ignorant of bitcoin until, say, 2020 or 2021?
LOL, Bitcoin has been crashing since it hit 20,000.  It's going to continue to crash until August. It won't pump back up till around November/December.  Best thing to do is sell and come back in August.
coinrail hacked
Main reason is probes into price manipulation. The hack is almost fully recovered.  

I never understand how there can be 30 bits of good, 2 bits of bad and it causes drops.  
No, it's just the dump phase of the 'pump and dump'.

The only thing anyone should be worried about is whether this is the final dump to oblivion.  If not, we will see the price pumped up again.
1800btc are mined daily. 

Looks like miners avoid to sell to keep the price hight. 

But they have to pay bills so they are forced to sell (gold bless pow).

So lots of Bitcoin on sell produce the dip. 
And the dip after the dip
I just did. 😊
Nty. I don't want to lose money.
skip the dip, buy the bottom
Ok.  I will buy when it hits bottom.

It's barely able to break out of 7.5k so it probably will go a lot lower.
Aaaaaaaaaaaanf the bottom is in :)

Just kidding, I think this thing is going much lower.
Giving up too soon? who knows? it starts first with the blood bath, after, tub of coins!LOLL
Careful, But if you can afford to loose your investment it'll be worth it....
Dumb move
We bottemed out. Get your money in
a hahahahahha u made my day
Have you tried this?

https://bitcoinelectrum.com/importing-your-private-keys-into-electrum/
Unless you can time the exact bottom, I would either buy in fragments (as you suggested) or buy on clear strength. The long\-term trend is definitely DOWN right now. Maybe we will hit a bottom soon; maybe we wont. Either way you really should only invest more than you can afford to lose.
Fragements, because if the price goes down then you could of got more at a better price. So I would set a time on when to purchase and not a price. Because if you put a price to buy at you may be waiting a while. I put $50 in a week no matter the price.
careful, investing needs to be cautious..
I spend 500$ weekly because that's what I could afford to do.  However last week I had 1k available so I put in 1k, I don't feel bad about that move even with this drop and will be purchasing 500$ worth tomorrow.
just wait till the end of the summer. technicals look like it will bottom around $4,000

fragments in case it bleeds further so you can cost average
Now is a decent time to buy, better to buy at $6800 then at $20k 
I’m routing for Italy.  Ohh wait they didn’t even qualify😂.  Yeah I’m still pissed.  
But..........Lambo tomorrow?

It needs to be a false prophet.

Tom Lee comes to mind.
It does, and it will all the times.....it is very volatile so expect the dip...Hopefully it will bounce back in no time
Lmao
Best excuse of the day!
investors will flock, with this dive, they will pour in investment...Hopefully!LOLL
Blame Bush. He helped create the environment that motivated Satoshi Nakamoto to invent bitcoin. 

Edit: of course the Dems are not free of guilt either by encouraging sub prime mortgages which led to the 2008 financial crisis.  Plenty of blame to spread around. 
if low volume exists, it means the market is deeming the value of the asset too high to be bought. In other words, the market does not wan't to risk in buying at this price.

Very very bearish to me for a very long time.
How soon do you think it will recover? Asking for a friend who wants to buy low.
ive never drink before and i dont have a girlfriend, do i win? :)
Yeah, stay calm, it is starting to go up.....step by step
That thread is epic. It feels just like today. Same people and same emotions. I like that one part about how bad you must feel buying at 600 and it's on its way to 50
and then 900...450...200...1

The true way to savour  a Bitcoin Dip. 

(this is  pretty good idea for a Belgian chocolate commercial) 
Coinbase is actually really good for day to day stuff. 
Paper wallet and steel plates.
nobody is bidding man...everytime it bounces nobody keeps bidding..typical sign of a bear market
It's on sale
New probe into top Bitcoin marketplaces
Honest opinion ? Atleast 5k i don't think we will see the bottom above that. 
Up.

Or down.


Who knows?
It only dropped 10%
Up we wait!
Yeah, gotta get the Cash app, created by square. The app is just called Cash, so it can get confusing. From there, at the top there should be a button for "Cash and BTC".
Cash app
Going up, wait further! it will be bulllish
> All of the above is not investment advice and is only IMHO.

The magic phrase that makes everything alright!
Relax! for there will be a time for everything to be well....investing needs a big heart!  Just go back to where is crypto before, and where is it right now
Jesus Christ, dude.
Sunday Bloody Sunday!
😆 
You think this is red.... crash after MtGox was red.

This is just a little pink
well it always respects 30 RSI on daily, so unless whales have just trained us for years it should bounce now. does not mean it wont go lower later though.
It‘s called gambling addiction and it‘s a real thing

Smart move. Doing the same thing. Too risky now to invest. There will be lots of opportunities down the road to decide.
I won't. : )
It’s been a while 
Unfortunately if this cycle repeated it would be done to 0. To recover from a 10% drop it would need to go up by 11% to get back where it was. Suffers a 50% drop? Need 100% gains to recover 
Agree

It already happened? Nov/Dec 2017 and later buyers is whom you‘re looking for.
Get a job and stop gambling.
What do you mean, I'm confused.
It’s gloomy but I’ll continue to Hodl
Also known as a bear flag.
Volume is up again, so when we hit bottom, we’ll see a rapid reversal.
I’d love to get some head right now
it is going up, wait steadily
yeah even if it falls to $20 it doubled from when it was $10
you shut your dirty mouth
longer the market keeps up like this, the earlier you had to have been in to see green. more and more people getting pushed out
2-3 weeks yeah 
no
Cool bro.

Edit: wich Investigation, you have link?
Hmm, this looks familiar. I remember people said this exact same shit when BTC was $13k.

Nice try but you can't fool me. 
You mean “Lambo?”
I dont understand how does that predict anything and where did Mcafee get that it will cost billions to mine?  I hope hes right
Bitcoin down 10% my Alt bag down 5%, go figure 
They're delusional. 
Gets the weak people out, the unfaithful jave no business here.
Market has to bottom out before it will rise to the top again.  Has to do with moving averages and other factors.
Because an aging coin racing to the bottom will finally decouple from stronger coins and the whole market will start moving free of this dinosaur 
sometimes hurting has a positive outcome!

Alrighty then, I give you permission to leave this sub, never come back, and focus your attention on things that aren’t massive failures.
You are a flea on bitcoin’s back.
Bye then.  Also you have got a bloody cheek saying Bitcoin is dragging down the alts, I think it's the other way around. 
Bitcoins aim has always been to solve the issue of trust and double spending.  To make good money that shines a light on bad money.  It has achieved this goal so far and looks to continue that trend at least in the short term.

Thank you for your FUD. Go away.

The trade is not going up and up, it is down and down: https://data.bitcoinity.org/markets/volume/2y?c=e&t=b

Also it is not a limited supply - there are 1800 new coins mined each day! Compared to 40,000 coins traded per day (most of that between bots).

Have you actually bought something with BTC? Know anyone who has?
Because BTC is a ponzi scheme for retards.
You mean you actually bought into the "limited supply" crap?  

Seriously?  

And exchanges were setup to cash in on the trading fees.  They are not your friends.

Ridiculous arguement. The faster your wife blows some other guy the sooner she will never do it again.

It will get there eventually. Might take another year or two if this is really going to play out into an extended bear market.
So if that was so obvious, what is coming now?
A quick look at your post history tells me everything I need to know about your crypto TA skills. Best of luck to you.
Bear market fixed, we did it Reddit! 
Don't use bold text. It's rude because it implies you think your own post are more important than others and  deserves to stand out more.

Only morons will believe his crap.

His price prediction was worked backwards from the future cost of mining.  And that is pure nonsense as the price has nothing to do with the cost.

Just because it cost $1m to develop something does not mean there will always be buyers willing to pay $1m.
Can't wait for this guy to finally lose the last of his integrity when he weasels out of eating his dick when he loses his bet
Are you posting links of an interactive chart 
Is that the most likely answer to you? It's a pretty wild prediction.
7k is the new 40k , we will never be above 7k again
That’s fairly interesting. 
what binance hack?  link?
But someone told me that HODL was the foolproof strategy. Are you saying that could be wrong?

You mean, a typical US American lifestyle?
Of course there is a set back, but knowing this platform, investing means willing to risk some.  We don't know, time will say: payback time!.
well lets not think about the costs to move gold around the world
The first Internet wasn't the best Internet.  It was just "the first Internet".  Bitcoin may or may not last, but this market is here to stay.  Too much potential and money invested (small and big players alike) to not be inevitable.  Just keep your eyes open for which coins are moving!  
That's not how it works. Everyone knows the ancient Chinese custom is to sell your bitcoin for Chinese New Year and buy it back after the June solstice. 
Observe the trends, be cautious on investing
Yes, feed the whales. 
Only if the ladies are in on the pact too. Don't want anyone ruining our fun.
I'd prefer a lime if you don't mind
Serious question, is this like a form of mindfullness?
descending triangle, tripple bottom. 

only the volume fucked bitcoin up
Think about this.. you would spend 5k to buy a single imaginary internet coin. life choices
The three of you buying is exactly why others should sell.  Ever hear of the Odd Lots Theory?
Just bought $500 BTC.
How soon do you think it’ll rebound? Asking for a friend who wants to buy low.
I’m with you, just bought $250.00 more
It's more likely that you will be forced to hodl at a loss for next 2-5 years.
Solution: Never invest more than you can afford to lose.
Well put
Formula, Patience/ calmness = Gold?! LOL
Say what?
Weak and highly speculative market
If this is the final dump to oblivion, then what a time to be alive! Because that would mean we just witnessed the biggest bubble in human history! 

Win-Win situation, in my opinion!
In reality, it is the dip after the dip after dip^dip.
I know but its better to HODL than to lose money
better hodl fiat. going to the moon soon
sometimes holding too much means loosing more!
Skip the bottom, buy the trench!
hodl double bottoms ;)
Sell your bottom?

Yap! trending like that......guess its time for the investors
lol why. If Im invested in btc for the long haul the best thing btc can do is drop.
I'm out
"sir, could you please hold the bag for me"
I've tried this. The import was successful, but I am not able to spend coins. There is an error message stating I am only watching the account. 
Buy now before it hits $4k
I have no idea but in my opinion, it’ll probably fall to 6k then hopefully forward from there

excuses, excuses, excuses! 
Nope. 

Nope. 

Nope.  Not a political sub. 
>In other words, the market does not wan't to risk in buying at this price.

It also doesn't want to sell at this price.
A drop in volume while the price is falling is a bullish signal. Higher lows on each downtrend is also a bullish signal.
Too high to be bought and too low to be sold.  
mmm...i see it more as stepping back and letting people do their thing. there are probably quite a lot of people who came in only for a quick price move. they aren't getting it and have been selling one by one since jan. 

i'm not buying {yet} but am still mining. once people get the selling out of their system i'll do some purchasing. i'd be surprised if we are still downtrending by next summer. psychologically hitting whatever the low is and trending sideways for 6 months or so, maybe longer would be a near perfect setup for the next uptrend. if the market appears to be dead you shake out the maximum number of coins
no thats just completely not right. High volume moves generally indicate there's strength behind a move and visa versa. Trading 101. 
Won’t ever pass 6k, anywhere around 7 or under is good price. I don’t think it will drop any lower than it did today though. Found good support and resistance around 6700. 
no, go on a bender, ill pm you when the price goes back up
It’s my favorite thread. A constant reminder for all those that will listen, that we’ve been here many times before. It sucks. But it will pass. 

There will always be people with little vision (or nefarious agendas) around to piss on your parade.  They will be proven wrong time and time again.  

I plan to be a constant thorn in their ass until we pull back up for the next bull run.   Then I will look down below and give them this: 🖕 😝
Hurts less when you check often and the fall in price is gradual.  On the other hand if you check weekly it might put some people into shock to see a 500 dollar dip each time you check.
The price goes down bit by bit...
(no it's not)
No, I want control of my own private keys.

_My keys, my Bitcoin. (Thanks Andreas)_
Does it really matter if its going to bounce right of that bottom and go to new ATH?
Margin called probably

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM4vblG6BVQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM4vblG6BVQ)
$1 million USD @ $8k BTC = 125 BTC volume

$1 million USD @ $7k BTC = 143 BTC volume

btc volume naturally rises with loss in fiat value, despite the same amount of fiat trading.
When it goes from 6.7k to 7.7k and then down to $4k. No one will regret it, except those those buying.
Indeed it has. So maybe it's time. 
i don't! invest! that's the key
In this world, anything that goes up must come down.  But the earth revolves and rotate, so wait till it come up, on top!!
please show proofs brother! so we were also be informed...
You know I read a post just like this from 2014. A guy was complaining about over paying at $600 in 2013. Dude was a total sucker. I mean who would pay $600 for Bitcoin
[deleted]
Well, it's gotten more and more expensive so far, so he must have extrapolated from that.
Ah yes, you can tell from the pixels.
Last time it bottomed out it almost hit 10k but then has been downhill ever since.
Oh cool, I'll have to look at this after work! Thanks friend!
Because everyone with 2-fingers of a brain understand that a market valued by pump schemes is nothing of good in the long term.

The price needs to be marked and supported by the real market economy and a sustained demand, not by trading manipulation or pumping schemes. 
IMO because you can't have unlimited growth. That kind of thinking leads to unbridled ponzi schemes that become detached from reality. 
When you're in a bubble it's hard to see out of it, but price corrections are healthy for market economies.
Mainly due to them being poor students without a pot to piss in and they don't like to see other people make money.
damn what heros you are. what do you expect longerm ? ath again? 
like as in permanently?
What’s the Ponzi scheme for us smart people?
Niiiiice lol, i own both.
investors were cautious, observing, what could be their next move?
This is what I have been doing all this time
I left for three and a half weeks and haven't posted in that time. I know what I do. Why ask a question you don't want answered? Seems useless. I don't wish poor outcomes on others. I'm just not naive.
You do understand the concept of an opportunity cost, right? Holding bitcoin for years, even if you don't lose paper value, is a huge loss because that money could have been in a different investment that is increasing.
I'll be here all month.
hahaha nope, I live in my own one bedroom apartment in one of the most expensive cities in America, and will able to afford a home in a couple of years (or now, if I decided to move to a more rural area). wanna know how? I don't blow my money on garbage "investments", such as bitcoin. 

by the way, [nice insight here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8prl4j/daily_discussion_june_09_2018/e0f8omh/), this comment really aged well. you really know what you're talking about huh?!
Yup, because you will leave her.It's perfect mate.
TA isn't about looking into a crystal ball.
Dude, don't take my reddit posts seriously Lmao, I fuck around a lot on these threads cause no one knows what they're talking about. i know enough to understand we were still in a downtrend and the probability for breaking out bearish was high.
Besides that, your reddit history tells me you're a little too pretentious in the face of logic or progression. But hey, not like reddit posts can be an accurate representation of character can it Lol. Good luck to you as well 
LOL I wish :"(  crazy price drops in last 24 hours
Whooops  I didn't know I was lol.  How do I turn it off?  I'm new to Reddit (notice I have 17 karma) 
Wow dude.  
Short rally by American money. 
He still says we will see 15k by end of July at the latest.  

https://twitter.com/officialmcafee/status/1005940089745297408?s=21
Yes it is humorous because it drops down to 0. I think that's a bug.
https://blockchain.info/charts/my-wallet-n-users

Follow the slope. It's extremely predictive.
I had said a few weeks ago I thought it might come in to double check the low. Gut thoughts. Im still very bullish long term, but short term can twist on a dime. 
"Redditor for 3 months"
So you will be uncleared until 2020? Ha.
You can carry it in your pocket. You can give it to someone else without anyone knowing it. You do not need a communication infrastructure or any kind of electronic device to transfer its ownership it to someone else. and it's free to transact with it (no fees required). 

Oh, my eyes are well hope, believe when I say that! :)
it is known
but that's all that matters. I don't care about anything else.
3 p's in trippple
I would sell it as it go up. Just enough to make a profit, and not wait too much to be a bagholder :-) 
Give me a break.  This happens to bitcoin over and over. It’s been proven the best time to buy is after a large drop.  Bitcoin always bounces back higher in the long run.   The bear market will end and the buyers will reap the rewards while guys like you sell it all and miss out on the gains. 

Nobody really knows but I wouldn’t be surprised to see 8k again next weekend.  Many people seem to think by September 
Bought $850
Not true at all. The big banking dynasties are getting in and the CFTC, the IMF boss and almost everyone I talk to are excited about Bitcoin and altcoins. Weak hands are leaving and it is being created by large investors who want to buy when there is blood in the street. You should move out of your mother's basement and get a real job.
if you had never heard of bitcoin, you wouldn't have had this bad luck with it.

 would you prefer to have never heard of bitcoin?
Crypto is volatile, whatever happens it'll be affected...hold onto it....whatever causes the drop, it will be temporary again
6.7k ...... You were saying something?  :)

Relax dude. I was being facetious. 
Miners won't sell below production costs, this market is quite similar to how the mining cost of gold influenced the gold market in the past.
They do if the price is falling like a brick 
Hence, the low volume. Interesting uh :)

The volume has been falling now for a very long time.
The volume has been falling for a very long time. So, those who are willing to sell, do not want to sell at low prices. Those who want to buy, are not willing to risk at this price because they don't know if they will be able to profit, since the market can even dip further.

Looks very bearish to me, without real market demand.
What high volume? Before this breakdown, there was barely any volume.
And btw, when there's a breakdown, there's always high volume, specially when you have players trying to grab the hot knife (testing the market by placing big buy orders in the lower levels, to try bump the price).

That makes sense.  Thanks, I appreciate the insight.  Really new to all this.
Buy when there's blood in the streets. Even if it's your blood.
Soon it will reach the bottom, time to invest and wait tilll it rockets up!
That's just jealous talking.
I don't sweat it over $50.

For a on-device wallet, I like BRD.

https://bitcoin.org/en/wallets/mobile/ios/brd/

For that to happen, money needs to flow into the market. That is not happening and there are a lot of whalers who want to buy at low to FOMO newbies into buying high. 

The cycle will not repeat itself. There needs to be a big change to support a real market demand for bitcoins.
why would it ever go back up 
thank you for a good roflmao...
Who would margin trade 100% of their net worth
$600 =/= $6700.

Try again.
Lego Lambo you mean
ofc that is true but his statement sounds more like 
proof of work coin cant fail
It goes downhill until buyers get more aggressive than sellers.  When they do, it will be a sudden turnaround.
If you get it working I would love to be your first customer. Let me know.
Then LEAVE. Don't spread FUD because you don't believe in the underlying tech.
ATH? nope... that was the bubble. I want the real market correction. 
Back to 1k, so can I buy in like I should have before.
USD.  

It's actually a superior Ponzi as the next generation of suckers aren't even born yet and they will be born into debt.
I know bud lol it’s all over your profile. 
Worth the wait, right?
What would have offered me the same return over a five year period that bitcoin has?
I'm a successful real estate agent/investor. I own 15k worth of crypto, none of which is BTC and I'll clear 250k+ this year. I own a home in the suburbs worth 750k, 3500 sqft, pool, shop, 4 car garage which holds my 67 Chevelle. I am by no means heavily invested in contrast to my assets and income. Don't assume everyone here will miss rent or fail to keep the lights on if btc goes to zero, it's a fun hobby for a lot of us. Oh btw that home is paid off and I'm 34 years old.
So youre saying we should all dump bitcoin??
wait til it bounces back!LOL

It's not looking so wild today. :)
so? who gives a fk about reddit
Well i can just write down my passphrase on a piece of paper and hand it to you right? And now lets say you send your gold to me (crossboarder i guess), lets compare fees now
Yeah well, try bringing 10 kilos of it on an international flight and see what happens.
It is known 
The moon is in the 7th double bottom's house. 
Interesting, ya I always find myself wanting to buy low and either buying low then it goes lower, or waiting and thinking it’ll go lower and it bounces up.  Guess I oughtta just buy now.
You are one of the few remaining delusional morons left.

Most have woken up to reality.  That huge increase in volume is the sound of people scrambling to dump while they can.  Make no mistake - this is a bank run.

Anyway, we will know in a few weeks on whether there will be a recovery or further declines.
Have you been eating Dr. Oetker frozen pizzas? 
what the fuck dude, its over , finito, bitcoin is dead, no one cares about bitcoin , all people want is some shitty altcoins
[deleted]
Now, we just have to wait and seem how miners will react to the continued increase in mining costs.
Indeed. It's a stand-off. The market is very undecided and waits for a signal.

All these ups and downs we've been seeing recently are just noise, generated by highly leveraged trades. No real market movement. TA will fail here.
why isnt THAT HAPPENING? venezuela and argentina money is coming in. might not me much but still its something that will hodl the price at some level. 
because there is a huge market for it and that means demand / supply = huge price
bottom means its not going lower right

There’s no way you actually did that 
That totally went over your head didn't it.  
[deleted]
Oh boy, lol...

If you think hope will solve anything, then you are in for a treat! 

Stop behaving like an ostrich that sticks its head inside the sand, and start looking at the reality of this market.

If Bitcoin demand does not rise, you will see the miners to begin dropping their bitcoins price. They need to pay their bills and they want to profit. Add to this equation the fact that there are lots of whalers out there with more than 10K in Bitcoins, and you will start to see some large dumps.

Good luck in *hoping for the best*! That will solve the problem for sure!
Definitely Iam still strong even after the value of my coins reduced by 70% this year.
I'm not saying investing in the past was a mistake, obviously there was a huge rise. But if you believe the market wont increase for 4 years, there is NO reason to hold bitcoin for that time.
No...I still hold mine, I'm just saying that a bull market is born in maximum pessimism and the sooner we get to that stage the better.
We need a massive cleanup like the one in 2014 to start building momentum again.
Oh, I am not by any means hoping it goes lower aside to accumulate more, but we are in an emotionally driven marketplace. Emotions run  hot and very cold!  haha
Nobody gives a fuck about your 0.0001BTC too.
Let us say there's no communications available. For example, after a storm where the power supporting the telecommunications is out. Or maybe the fiber optic cable was cut and there's no time-frame to when it will be replaced. How will we communicate in the first place? Or issue a transaction to a miner?
You are right on that. There's a lot of restrictions but the market is still much larger and more stable. 
Be sure to save this comment and message me for a handout in 2-5 years, don't worry I got you little doubting Thomas.

I'm not kidding either I've already insured a friend if he's not doubled his 1k investment in 2 years I will cover the difference.  I've never gone back on my word.

Buy Bitcoin and save the world :)
They are really good!
Well, it's obviously heading in the wrong direction :)
As soon as strong alts get fiat pairs there’s little reason to use bitcoin... Institutional money isn’t coming.
Why would anyone would want to exchange Bitcoin for Venezuelan Bolivar? Makes no sense... 
well from here it seems more people are losing interest in bitcoin than gaining.  most people I try to get into it have already heard about it from the bull run and want nothing to do with it.  the price is just as likely to keep going down as it would to go back up, right? 
Yeah. Kinda like how loads of people were saying 7k was bottom and we'd never go below it again. 
Don't underestimate the value of the Lego Market! It's huge!!!
You are still just as much of a noob as you were 11 months ago when asking why the price was taking a correction....
70&#37; off an all\-time high. 
>But if you believe the market wont increase for 4 years, there is NO reason to hold bitcoin for that time.

Then *say* that and not the bullshit alluding to the benefit of hindsight with regards to the current situation.
Satellites exist.
Worst case the end is near scenario you mean? In that case gold would be worthless too. Food, tobacco, medicins and guns would be the favoured currencys... not gold. ;)
Now why would anyone doubt the word of an anonymous shill on Reddit?

2-5 years?  BTC and this forum may not even exist by then.
indeed! freeze! wait for your luck!LOOL
so they were wrong 

You just grab on to that hope, young sailor!
