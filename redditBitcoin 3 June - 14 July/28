Daily Discussion, June 17, 2018 -- TITLE
I don't understand. I thought everyone at the world cup was going to use Bitcoin. Shouldn't it be mooning right now?
In T minus 1 hour we will be precisely 1 week since bloody Sunday.  Let hope we dont see a repeat...
Sell them digital beanie babies while you still can. 
Bitcoin now is stable coin.
Happy Father's day to all the great dad's in this subreddit! For you guys, I hope we head to the moon today! ❤️
if we turn the chart upside-down, we're mooning higher guys! :)
lolol somebody keeps putting up and taking down a 50btc buy wall on GDAX like once per second. 
Please, hurry up and retest $6200.  This is getting boring.
Why do people say the volume is low ? Yes it's lower than when it was above 10K during the craze but compare the volume 1 year ago and the volume now : it's 2x higher.  
More than 3 Billion USD worth of volume these last 24 hours.
When we crossed 1K USD at the beginning of the recover from the 2014 crash, the volume was at about 145 Million USD.
Lets pump it at least 500000000000000000000 Venezuelan Pezos!!!
Happy Father's Day to Bitcoin.

Come on 5k! I need this more than anything I get 10k if it hits from a bet
zzzzzzzzz
Lets pump it at least 500 Mexican Pezos!!!
There is no moon. Only space stations. But seriously, can we get a lift?

Am I the only one still buying?
This is just getting tiresome now. I mean, what really is the fucking point anymore? It doesn't have mass adoption. Its store of value is essentially more and more worthless with each passing week. And, the average cost to mine it is closely approaching its price. I really just want to see it drop so far down that the miners shut down and it collapses once and for all. As much as I want to believe all the stupid predictions of '15k by July' and other such BS, the average human is too stupid to give three shits about ever buying or using this useless currency.  Bitcoin has lost. Humans don't deserve this technology and clearly have no clue what to do with it now that they have it.

Guys, I done goofed and forgot to get a Father's Day gift for my dad who lives on the other side of the planet. Is there a way to buy Amazon points using Bitcoin (specifically, Canadian Amazon points) and send it to him?

Edit: just bought some Amazon gift points for him. First time I've ever spent Bitcoin! Kinda cool :)
He is like a person who hates when things are going good. He bought bomb making material after Waco. Bitcoin was doing fine so he had to fuck it up somehow and boy did he. 2-3 years at least. We will recommend japan take care of him and arrest when they see the evidence we have. 
FBI is gathering information for the case against crouch wright in Florida. He forged a dead man ‘s signature. His care is open and shut. He will corporate or spend 30 years in jail. 

When these two dick fucks get out of the market, we can build and meet potential rather than divert assets to deal with scumbags. Craig should go to jail for 20 years. There’s nothing he knows that we don’t. I’m going to push to not allow him to testify for a lesser sentence. He’s too much of a scam artist. 
Barely sustainable even at mining prices. This is it, folks. 
I have a possibly very dumb question. Is it true that if A and B use lightning, any transaction between can only start with an invoice? That is if A wants to send money to B, B has to send an invoice first? Or can A also send some money to B without B having to create an invoice?
Just tried to buy bitcoin on coinbase and nothing happened... anyone else have problems? 
There have been no new comments for 50 consecutive minutes...

All I know is that Bitcoin is far from dead.
Damn, that volume's low...

60,000 in 2018 when futures hold back manipulating the market now that they got called out and USA stops leading the market. Germany and China have better tax free laws. USA makes tax regs confusing on purpose. Let the 2nd and 3rd largest economies take over the crypto market. 
Too much hype in december last year. People right now not buying cause they know it can fall in just 1 day 
Since january we got 0 progress
The bad thing is that we dont break 10k last time. After too much dump people just give up, and no one want risk their money.
If bitcoin drop to 5k i think its a beginning of the end.
mt gox destroy cryptomarket and that is true.When was the key moment to break 10k he just drop his stolen bitcoins...
So i think 6k is a last chance to pump price. If we go down it will be over.From 5k to 4 then to 2 and lower.

new ath incoming
It's the powers that be that are pushing it down.

They know they are losing.
Price is being kept here for a purpose unknown.  Fingers crossed 
Is the market cap for crypto going to hit 1 trillion this year? 
bulls are back boiz
I’m finding his tweets to be very entertaining and often thought provoking.  Your mileage may vary.

Question... From what I've seen now a new patch? Is released and you choose to move to the new... Version or not? What's the difference between this and a hard fork? Are you able to decide not to switch to the new version and you btc can still be traded? If a backdoor is placed and no one notices it for God knows we don't read enough and even so 99% of the people who took the time wouldn't understand 1% of the code.... Wouldn't it crash everything? If some one with enough btc moves to another version wouldn't everyone follow suit without even questioning it like a herd?

Thanks for your help probably I'm wrong even from the start of my train of thought... 
We’re sliding again, hang on!
I should of sold my beanie babies when they were worth something
Would be interested in seeing a chart correalting the fall of bitcoin against DW websites starting to use other means of exchange. 
Just bought 1TH at genesis mining, paid in BTC. I was totally impressed by the payment process. The second I sent my BTCs, the website notified me it was a success. It's the first time I buy something with BTC and I just realised how amazing BTC is. It was faster than using my credit card and clicking all the buttons and waiting for SMS confirmation code.
Keep selling you guys are helping me when my bet thank you so much for listening to me
When the smart crowd going to jump in and save this user interface problem ?  Andreas can’t even safe it. We need psychologists he said. 
Will never see 7k again Bitcoin is dead it will slowly drop to nothing 30 btc trying to be sold only 1 btc for a buy it's done it's over guys sell

Nah they are using BTC at the world cup and the merchants are selling it for Roubles which explains the drop in price

Actually if you rotated it upside down, the trendline would still point downwards. What you need to do is flip the chart upside down but as a mirror image.

Accumulation
Bitcoin says no.
Lots of people here have the memory of a goldfish, they tend to forget everything that happened more than 2 days ago... 
Because it is.
After reading years worth of comments. My opinion on what you just said is because a lot of the people in here and a lot of the people that are vocal in the space have less than 6 months experience. 

If you got into the market around Christmas time it would feel like The Sky Is Burning. You have experienced nothing but Falling
cause people look at bitfinex, not noticing that bitmex volume is increasing. Bitfinex lost the lead position due to their ridiculous rules.
You’re going to win that bet. 
Sorry 
Get some sleep.  
what are u planning to do on the moon anyway? not like theres any warm pools with hot qt grills or anything. i say take your moon, shove it someplace
Nah. Two of us at least. 
capitulation. boom.
Never underestimate the stupidity of human beings.
Remember the real reason it failed? Banks don't want it.

Plus, why pay a FEE to change your US dollars, which everyone takes and prefers, into a crypto currency to buy the same thing which is much easier with straight cash?
We are only 6 months past massive hype. Give it some more time. 
So the currency is "useless" but if you don't buy it you're"stupid"?
Did you not look at the history of Bitcoin before buying in?  It has done this many times before and will undoubtedly do it again so you might as well get out asap if you can't handle it.
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hype\_cycle#/media/File:Hype-Cycle-General.png](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hype_cycle#/media/File:Hype-Cycle-General.png)
Real world application of blockchain is growing.  Check out UPS use for logistics.  These are important value generators.

BTC failed as an experimental currency the moment the exchanges got into the game and encouraged speculation.  

And as history shows, the market is ruthless in weeding out non productive assets the moment speculation ceases.
Maybe just send him the Bitcoin and some love.

Holy fuck you made my head hurt.  I have no idea what the fuck you were trying to say.
That was an entertaining read.
How often does items get sold below manufacturing costs. It will settle around $1000 for that type of thing to happen. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2711461.msg39999176#msg39999176


your entire post history is nothing but shit talking bitcoin. why are you even here? 
No, you can send money without it having to be requested first.
Plenty
the part past the final area where the graph drops to 0
It's annoying to see people professionally try and speculate on what causes the price to go up and down. Use a little common sense, ignore cointelegraph, forbes and nonsense youtubers. Something like Bitcoin doesn't just become valuable to likes of $6,454.00 for no reason at all. It has real use in the blackmarket and makes payments in today’s economy easier for businesses, persons & governments.

Scenario's that affect it's trading cycle are the following:

\- Rival Coins & Technology

\- Adoption

\- "Laws" & "Regulation" (This being the most important one!)

I'll put the current price drop all down to the scheduled EU re-meet for the end of this month, were likely to see the price drop down even further leading upto the last week of June when it's discussed on an international level. If you truly followed Bitcoin and "believed" in it, you would have realised this and sold on the last high of £7,100 and would be waiting buy back in at this time. Most professional Bitcoin traders knew the price would fall in mid June-July. Wait for it folks, i'd say £4,500 would be safe price to go in at but i have my alert set at £4,200. Keep dedicating time to understanding it all, everything involving money is linked together.

\- Windy
Youre lagging a bit
Dude, China already has the largest economy by GDP/PPP.

EU is Number 2 and USA is Number 3.

And BTC is already controlled by China with >50% of the miners based there.
The reptilians?
lol

If you think Bitcoin has put a dent in the bottom line of any Bank you're sorely mistaken. 
Wealthy over-the-counter buyers doing their thing.

I'm skeptical but interested.
It's been an hr now, how can we trust you when you can't even get that right?
Are you joking or bein serious?
>From what I've seen now a new patch?

yes.

>Is released and you choose to move to the new... Version or not?

yes. it's free of choice. Your old version will continue to work. Updating software is always a good idea.

>What's the difference between this and a hard fork?

A hard fork is a fundamentally different thing. A hard fork is simply the clone of your program but it's no longer compatible with your program (as in bitcoin cash vs bitcoin) or a different approach (like in LibreOffice and OpenOffice). Hard forks are usually a total different team splitting away from the original program towards a (in their eyes) "way better solution". A simple software update like this is in no way connected to a hard fork.

>If a backdoor is placed and no one notices it for God knows we don't  read enough and even so 99&#37; of the people who took the time wouldn't  understand 1&#37; of the code.... Wouldn't it crash everything?

A lot of people are contributing to bitcoin. A lot of people are reading differences between this and the last version which is easy to do. Each piece of new code submitted to bitcoin is heavily reviewed and Acknowledged before it's merged into the master. Google "pull requests". One could not simply walk into master with his own code. Technically it could "crash everything" but that will not happen. It just won't.

>If some one with enough btc moves to another version wouldn't everyone follow suit without even questioning it like a herd?

We're talking about a simple software update here, not about a complete other system where someone with huge amounts of btc moves into. A software update happens from time to time and everyone is just updating software because it's a good thing.

Edit: OOOH, it's my cake day <3
It is always BTC, forget it.  Your wallet works exactly the same.
I'm curious, what other means are you speaking of?

dude your post history is nothing but fud. in some of them you even admit you're trying to manipulate. you have bets? get outa here with that
Still wrong. 3k BTC in April 😭😭😭 someone missed the run to 10k. 
I remember when people were talking about using bitcoins to actually buy hotdogs :(
right.. 

I sell you my BTC for 9000 If that is closer to the real price. Every exchange even the decentraliced ones are showing a fake price !

Should still be a good deal for you since the real price is way higher!!
What are you basing this on?
That was poorly executed 
God go away, your analysis is invalid already! 
They're not accumulating shit lmao they're just setting and pulling orders to bait people into buying. 
1.  I can remember thousands of things that happened more than 2 days ago.

2.  Fish is good for your brain.  A goldfish's brain is composed of 100% fish.  Ergo, they have excellent memories.
Shhh, don't wake him up - he already is.
Eat cheese.
three. 
we are approaching capitulation,  but still are not there.  You'll know it when you see it.
that meme graph is a great way to invest your money
It was different this time. Bitcoin was everywhere. It went mainstream and the general public shrugged. Bitcoin will never gain widespread adoption. 
My love isn't worth anything so, I think I'll just send him Bitcoin next year.
Sweet, thanks!
Looks like this is only available in the States, but I did some searching and found something. Thanks again!
Great thanks!
Well aren't you a pocket full of firecrackers.
Should I point out that you said it was annoying to watch people speculate on the market only to point out that right after you said that you went on to speculate about what was happening in the market....

Come on now who starts a paragraph with "it's annoying" and is over the age of 20
China took a shit on all the miners so quite a few are gone.
True, why does China bit like bitcoin when they have all the miners. That is too centralized. The nodes are the only thing keeping it centralized. It’s why Bcash will die soon cause they gave 32 mb blocks to Chinese miners. Ver hates the USA. He’s getting charged once negotiations with the state department are completed. 
If you think you understand my point you are sorely mistaken.

You are a fool.
Sometimes I hope you collapse 
Does Woods shit in the bear? 
Luck?  That's the result of 20 hours of TA!
Abusing on the premise that you know what you are talking about if what I've read is true gold's market cap is at the moment 100 times the market cap of btc, treating btc as a more liquid store of value I'd guess we could estimate a share of gold's market cap to transfer to btc, from that share we need to deduce what will fall into icos and other cryptos... Do you think this would be a better way to estimate the price of btc? Coming back from gold's value atm? 
Still on track: https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7ptsg3/2018_cryptocurrency_crash_elliott_wave_final/
cheese is the devils creation, interesting
In my circle it barely registered. It was something that made the news but nobody understood it. It needs like 10 years. 
np!
My post is based in the information in your link, justified speculation vs randomly analysing price increases and decreases throughout it's conception. Graph analysis in crypto doesn’t quite work in the way it does for actual asset based stocks. No need to get offended, it's just my two cents... or maybe your one of those assholes that likes to market his lame his predictions through fake accounts. Now you can get offended. :)
Personal foul, ten yards and a new first down
Someone is out of retirement. 
Maybe be less melodramatic next time and state your point if you have one instead of trying to sound mystical and cryptic with talk of "powers that be" trying to supress Bitcoin because "they are losing" lmao. 

Who's losing? What are they losing? Educate us oh wise crypto savant.

If a bear shits in the woods does anybody hear it plop?
There are a number of ways of estimating the value of BTC.  Comparing it with gold is one way.  Nobody really knows.

If you imagine BTC eventually achieved the same market cap as gold, then that figure divided by 21 million would give one indication of value of 1 BTC, as there will never be more than 21 million in circulation.

Alternatively, you could speculate that BTC could be responsible for, say, 1% of World trade transactions, and use that figure.

Who knows? :)
Hodl for 10 years got it
Sending 50&#37; to short LoL! .... what an idiot....
Look up the definition of melodramatic you half-wit.

Just because your mom and dad told you that you are bright does not make it so.

I'm not going to break down every single thing in my 2 sentence post because you are incapable of thought.
Yes, the pope.
I'm thinking on behavioral economics, the way it works and the narrative behind up until now is digit gold, I'd think that a nice estimation would be comparing it with gold ath and going backwards, I also was checking out property being sold for btc against an expected 30 40 50 percent margin profit being calculated on the price of selling the property but then I saw that they are instantly morphing back to Fiat the second you transfer them the value, still some one is buying the btc at the same moment back.... Which confuses me.... They are not taking it directly but some one else is... Why? 
Melodramatic; adjective
of, like, or befitting melodrama.
exaggerated and emotional or sentimental; **sensational or sensationalized; overdramatic.**

You're also slinging insults like a 10 year old throwing a tantrum. The irony of this is you responded exactly as I expected: nothing of substance to say and not a shred of insight into what you claim to understand. 

S a d. 
Flagrant foul, 2 shots and the ball back
The great attraction of BTC as an investment, despite its flaws, is its decentralised nature; the fact that it is tried and widely trusted and, perhaps more importantly, its severely limited and finite supply.
What is wrong with you dude?
That's what baffles me, let's say Satoshi starts dumping, or  not him but another whale account, it could crash the market in a second, so decentralized... Mining afaik is not profitable for your average Joe or needs a heavy capital investment, transfer of value cannot be stopped in any way but it will leave a permanent record which can be traced back with an exact time stamp and God knows that if you have the money you can find out anything in this world... So... I don't know....


In contrast the wealthiest wallets are not dumping, the golden bag has not been breached which baffles me.... Everyone's got a price but people on this thing have made... Generational wealth is an understatement... And they are holding! Why o. O
Still waiting for you to explain your statement. 

Who is losing? 
What is being lost?
Who is "they"

Can you actually back any of this up or do you just post this in the hopes that it might pump the price of Bitcoin? 

Let me save you the trouble;

Nobody is scared, no powers that be take Bitcoin that seriously. The price has fallen because we're in a bear market - not because it's being suppressed by anybody. There's no volume, no interest in crypto among the general public, and no FOMO money pouring in. 

Now stop with these silly conspiracies about POWERS THAT BE.
You've answered the question - it could crash the value.

If De Beer's sold all the diamonds they owned, diamonds might be worth jack shit :)
[deleted]
There is a reason they don't do this. It's not profitable. Imagine for a minute you had a hundred thousand Bitcoin. If you just push the sell button on a market exchange the price will indeed drop one hell of a lot. Or, you could wait for better news and you can use what you have to push for things that you know are going to draw in people and then when it goes on a tear you can slowly start selling some of your coins into the strength. The Winklevoss twins are a great example of this. They have a ton of Bitcoin. They can sell everyone they have right now and they would have made just a ridiculous profit. They don't because they know they would literally be selling the bottom. 

If you have a couple hundred dollars in your bank account right now I know it probably sounds cool to think that if you had 50 Bitcoin or whatever you could just sell them at this price and your lifestyle would be quite a lot better. That's true and people have. That said a lot of these large wallets are held by people who don't have to worry about money anymore. It's numbers on a screen and just like an 80s video game when you are trying to run up points. The whole goal is to get as many points as possible
Are you drunk?
But it's not moving... Why hold one of the biggest bags ever and not even take a monthly share of the pie... Start using it to advance faster, I saw this pinaple trust that recently stopped working but why? We could program a trust of randomly generated wallets, sent every year to a randomly selected trust of highly acclaimed phds on their fields validated by the best universities around the world  and share these wallets for donations to be made and really push the boundaries, with the kinds of wealth in some parts of the world it's incredible that in  well planned 24 hours you could end much of the people's problems on every part of the world right? This Is the value of decentralization? Our generation acknowledging that our parents have been playing a loosing game against clever people who stablished an apparently  unbreakable status quo and almost all of the administrative jobs are the real bubble? We pay the salaries of people who are good at making us believe they got their shit straight when in reality don't even know how Facebook works? And we give them the keys to nuclear missiles! Oh man the world is fucked up.... 
I've met an ether early investor, she is not able to cash out because the guy who first offered the investing opportunity told her that he would pay her every bit of the last ath price ever, but she was not able to sell any ether until he told her so... This creeps the fuck out of me... How are they making even more money with all this waves, at least this (maybe wrongly) has given me some solace that I'll know when to pull out (Tehee, I love out Peter pan generation) but it just sounds so crazy! 
No are you?

Why don’t you address my questions instead of trying to divert? 

You called me a half wit - yet it’s looking like you don’t have much to say when you get called out. 

Feel free to answer my questions anytime. 
Probably because there is a reasonable chance that that story is fabricated

Pretty sure he's talking about Austin Powers.
I'd like to suggest you chill the fuck out.  This may help:

I’m extremely calm.
You’re still trying to divert. 

And still no answer to my questions. Thanks for proving my point. 
Wow.  There is something wrong with you.

I wish you the best and I hope you get help & never kill someone.
There's nothing wrong with me at all. 

The problem here - which belongs to you - is that you made a statement based on nothing and got called out on it and are unable to back it up. 

Then you tried insulting me when you realized you couldn't back up what you said, but that really doesn't work as it just highlights your ignorance. 

I hope you learn from this.
I'm freaking out man!!
You are insane.

Get help.  I''m done with this.
