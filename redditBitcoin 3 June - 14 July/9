My natural growth senses are tingling.
RogerCoin is struggling to hold 0.11.

(I know some don't even like the mention of that lying, mendacious project on these boards.  I fully understand that; but when it declines like all the other other shitcoins, Bitcoin prevails.)

Pump it Rog, pump it Jihan! - or have you run out of money?
Real quiet in here lately. I think that's my buy signal.
What's up, hodlgang?

The FUD against Bitcoin is absolutely amazing. These sites and editors (NY Post especially) post FUD and they buy it when the price falls. I think they are helping us giving this buying opportunity cause most people when they hear decentralized currency with Lightning Network nodes, love it. Bring the FUD. Let us buy cheaper. 4 million coins are lost. Total supply is only 17,000,000 by year 2120. 

The infrastructure will be so established by than and why do we care 120 years from now. That generation will be smarter than any before it and can deal with it than. Let’s get lightning up and running for the 2nd wave of global users who will try it again in November and not have to pay massive fees. 4 cents tops

When moon?
Go bitcone!
Weekend sales are here
Looks like it may bounce off the ichimoku support here

Daily Hopium:

&nbsp;

As Lightning Network grows, Bitcoin's price is likely to increase as more people start using it for everyday transactions:

&nbsp;

>"If — and it's a big if — the lightning network delivers what we hope it will, then bitcoin will take a big leap forward in speed, scale and usability," Goodman added.  
>  
>The Lightning Network will allow users to affordably buy cups of coffee again this will allow bitcoin to function better as a medium of exchange, in theory increasing value.

You know I was just sitting here thinking. Bear Market is going. Disbelief is pretty much everywhere. All kinds of people think Bitcoin is going to zero. Now I know and many of you know that they are going to be the same people that fomo in at far higher prices. And you know what? I don't feel the least bit sorry for them if they buy the top and lose it all. They don't really believe in the project. They just want to click a button and then click it again to make more money. They deserve what they get
If we can just stabilize for a few months that’ll probably be the most realistic good scenario 
Can we get past $6750-$6800 today? 
Once upon a time ...
Now we know who's making money in bitcoin: the exchanges

https://cointelegraph.com/news/world-s-largest-crypto-exchange-binance-expects-2018-profits-up-to-1-billion

It's like when I used to play poker. Regardless of who wins or loses, the casino always makes a profit off of the rake (the fees that poker players pay).
good morning my friends :)
can anyone answer a question for me?
Thanks Trump. Now Lakebtc has hacked my account and stole all my bitcoin. Lesson learned never use an exchange not in the US.
**How much BTC should a person have?** OK, apart from... "as much as you can get".
If BTC does become what we hope, what amount would, do you think, be enough to make a major difference in a person's life? Not lambos, just no financial worries. Assume you bought or have BTC now, and are looking 10 years down the road.
.1 BTC is 100 million sataoshi, if its gets to 1 penny per sat., .1 will make you a millionaire, currently .1 is about like $850 US I think. So yeah about 5 years .1 will probably be over 100 thousand US $ I think.
Continued sideways movement provides very little incentive for new investors.
Hope I haven't killed the positive trend. I purchased a few sats for the first time since the 10k bullrun. Otherwise I have  been absent and hodling through the downturn.
My post about crypto in terms of sausages is below.  It has been roundly ignored.

Give it an upvote or downvote please.

You can't allow classic posts like this to go unnoticed.
My balls are bullish ;)
What are you talking about? It values at 724USD @ Bitfinex.
I think it's more like they both own so much of it the float is pretty small so when prices turn around it always takes off. I'm just curious what those guys are going to do when lightning Network is completely developed and functional. Is the coin going to just completely die off? Will it still have a use case?
When it’s 100k+ USD/BTC then anything less than $20k will look cheap.
Other than the daily hype and shilling, what "bullish news"? Do tell.
Shrek is love. Shrek is life.
He is definitely responsible for the price falling with his bullish forecast and all 🙄
because of his appearance on CNBC yesterday?  Or did he say something today?
Bring ‘em on!


No homo. 
Yes.
In search of more instability :)

Crypto definitely has a future, and I'm well invested in it, but I don't think a 'general' financial instability will help it grow.

Pockets of instability are more likely to.  
It's ironical but cash actually flowed back in stocks on the very first day of the trade war.  

I can't explain it.
How old are you?  

Serious question.

i really think alot of the fud against btc is unjustified
It's had me salty the past few days. I mean it's one thing if you have a legitimate criticism but a lot of it is just straight fabricated trolling
When sun sets
All kindz of gainz
and here we go baby!!
How many miners r u gonna be running?
So, if BTC will be soooo valuable, why waste it on coffee?
I'm one of those people.  I hope they all buy.  Helps everyone.  Started getting in back in November.  Rode the Dec highs...and the since then lows.  
I don't think anyone is thinking that it's going to zero.

More likely (I'm one of them), it is not knowing what's the right price.

I would much rather than regulators step in and stop all the price manipulations.  That way, we can have a proper price discovery and arrive at some agreement on price.
Sure.  It was 6.72k just two days ago so it's not a big huddle.
No.
You had the chance for 'Furst' , gone :(

Yes. I just did.
It's FDIC insured though right? 
Evidence?
Immortals ask all kind of weird questions here
Whatever amount can make a difference now, adjusted for bitcoin. If youre asking where BTC will be in 10 years, that's a fantastic question nobody can answer haha
1 BTC.  I can live well with $100m.

We are the future nouveau riche and we don't need to do any real work.

In the meantime, all of us just need to sit back, do nothing but cry HODL every now and then.  Of course, we need to come to reddit and attack anyone who even suggest that we are wrong (because we think reddit influence the world).


10 years down the road if you have one you're going to be a one percenter

Keep in mind the longer this goes on the more of them that find their way into strong hands. As that happens the price is going to naturally rise. Every single day someone new learns about Bitcoin and they buy a little piece. People sometimes complain because the rate of that has slowed down since 2017 but it is still in full effect. For the past 9 years the best thing someone could have done is get their hands on a bit of Bitcoin and kick back. I don't see any evidence to change that thesis. The only one that could is if the lightning network never works on a large scale. 
0.05 would be huge i think.
Honestly..the fire and forget amount is probably one btc. That's life changing if bitcoin manages to reach what it promises (eg 1m)

Committing any more capital really depends on how much money you have to begin with 
I think with time the value of money decreases. So, today you might be very happy with 1 BTC but tomorrow that 1 BTC might not even mean anything. 
5 coins
I would say 1 BTC. Because whatever the price s thats what You have. If btc is 1mil then you have 1mil. Most people don't understand a million dollars is not a lot of money. You spend that much on a child from birth to 18 years old. So I would say one bitcoin for every kid you have or plan on having. And If you don't plan on having children then 1 BTC will do ya.
No 1 BTC is 100 million satoshi. 
1 Vietnamese dong = 100 Vietnamese Hu

1 USD = 22,962 dong = 2.2m Hu

Congrats, all of us who own 1 USD is a Hu millionaire.
About the time that all those Iraqi dinars re-value, I bet.
Depends on the investment goal. Money you can afford to lose, perhaps a modest investment that you can drop on Bitcoin and not obsess over wouldn't be a bad move based on sideways movement of a technology that is in the midst of growing infrastructure. 

There are plenty of people that might want to make that move to profit on the potential of future growth. Just embrace a realistic timeline.
Most investments are judged based on year over year performance. That said, nothing is sideways here. Zoom out, fool.
Worse, since about March it has been one long "downward stairs", i.e., drop, stabilize for a while, drop again, stabilize for a while, drop again, etc. What serious investor would go long in that? The only way it to stop the downward stairs is if \*something fundamental\* occurs to change the value of BTC. What that might be, who knows, but whatever it is will have to be pretty dramatic and convince investors that BTC will be going up and not just continuing its downwards stairs march.
I think someone deleted it. I can’t find it 
Crypto blockchain sausage links?
Bullish balls 
That is 723 USD too high.
They're fucked.
Or it has fallen into the mid-5000s and 6500 starts to look like yet another sucker bet. I'll go with that one.
Im all in on btc but why hasn't anyone mentioned lakebtc being hacked. Are they going to wait for the price to increase then alert everyone so they don't buy btc. 
Thing is I am not joking, it was one of the oddest things to see. For a whole minute I paused my friday evening to just watch Shrek's face fly through the sky like a driveby.
Investing in an uncorrelated asset reduces volatility. All major assets are correlated right now. If bitcoin can chill out at this level or go up it could see inflows. 
I think its stock buy back and these huge companies buying each other.
Buy the rumor sell the news
I thought it would drop a little bit, as well.
People of any age can spew shit like that. Trump‘s 72 and he sounds just like what u/KalEll66 wrote..
58
Can’t wait for the book. 
Lambo after sun?

Get out of here with your logic. 
Coffee ☕️ is valuable too
exactly. even the players don't know what bitcoin is. this whole spend vs HODL thing is getting stale.
And that's totally cool. You're along for the ride and you're learning more about the space. I'm talking about the doubters. The negative people who only exist to take advantage of others. Buttcoiners. The last stage fomo buyers. 

I'm just tired of all their Fud. A lot of it is not even factual. It's just emotional outbursts
What you just said I feel is healthy. That's a legitimate concern. 

I agree
7 months into a bear market, bear markets can have strong Rally's also, but I don't think it's over.
Yep come tax time I claiming a loss, No worrys.
No, not asking for a price prediction, but what amount you think a person should have in BTC for the future. Or even, what goal do *you* have for an amount  you want to have and Hodl.
I mean that‘s always how it works, right? The people who buy and hold into a hype right after it was pushed by mainstream media are always the ones who come out on top. Late adoption ftw.
This would be great, if it works out that way! 
>	what it promises

What *who* promises? Thought this stuff was decentralized.
Hmmm.
Anyone who thinks a million dollars is not a lot of money needs to re-evaluate their life imo.  
Underrated ramble of the day
Yes, BTC is 100 million satoshi.
I'm stupid, my bad you are correct.
Nobody cares about Iraqi dinars here. It is a totally different thing.   Sheesh, you sound like Dave Ramsey. Is it that you Dave?
I think you need to consult your FUD handbook again, you need new material.
Don't insult the dinar.  It has a real world use case as a currency and can be used to pay taxes, goods and services.
I’d rather see it go sideways than down.
Why is he a fool?

You can zoom in, and zoom out, and find good or bad future predictions, depending on the timescale.

Even on the 1 week scale, the moving averages don't look good.

I'm heavily invested in BTC - but let's not get offensive to fellow posters when someone makes a perfectly reasonable point.

Which timescale are you working with?
Not always. Investment reports are generally issued per quarter.
Actually, it's based on future performance.  

Past performance is merely used as a validation.
Don't worry, if there's nothing to freak out about, people will make something up!
Bitcoin is one positive regulation away from $50,000. What will it be? Ask your country’s government.
It's rubbish anyway.

Looking at my portfolio and coins I watch, over 7 days almost everything is green, except for RogerCoin - do you think it is finally dying?


As a farmer, I can confirm that bulls have huge balls.
Isn't the market always right?
You don't just comment negatively occasionally, you comment negatively consistently. Now it's your business to form your perspective based on the info you have. But why hang out in a Bitcoin forum where investors socialize and exchange info, if you simply just feel so negatively toward crypto? I've seen your comments and they are all gloom.

Clearly you're not going to invest in something you don't believe in, so what could you possibly gain from spending your time in this thread? Are you that bored?
I hope it goes much lower so I can acquire more. Utility of bitcoin going forward is awesome. I’d happily pay a few Satoshis per view to never see ads again. I bet I’m not alone.
That's nothing. It falls a thousand dollars? Sure maybe it can. There is so much more potential on the upside.

Cost average into a position and sit back
Shrek hodls.
I'll always have this memory now where nobody believed I saw a flying airballon with the face of Shrek.  
Hmm.  That sounded authoritative - I'll go with that.

But what does it mean?  Could you run it past me again?  I have an escaped big cat problem.
Arnn't graphic card days over?
1 asic miner is better, yes?
I would not spend my coffee on Bitcoin!
Hodl doesn’t mean don’t ever spend it.  It means don’t panic sell on the dips/crashes. 

At this early stage of adoption, there will be a lot of price volatility.  Any bitcoin spent by an individual should be immediately repurchased with new fiat to avoid losing out on gains. 

At later stages of adoption (when lightning network will become necessary) the price will become less volatile.  It will still grow, but much more gradually.  This would make it unnecessary to immediately replace with new fiat to avoid losses as the short term losses would be minor. 
Thanks.  Let's just say that I'm realistic and not trying to overthrow governments, bring down banks, get rich sitting on my bum, etc.

Throw out the manipulation and we get price stability.  That will make it investor grade and the institutions will come.  With that, adoption as a currency supplementing fiat will happen.

At the moment, it's just plain ridiculous.
dont ride on my english. obviously i mean the potential of bitcoin once widespread adopted. if bitcoin ever reaches that; i think 1 btc enough
So tell me why so many millionaires go broke? They have more than a million dollars and they still end up poor. A million dollars is not alot of money. Well its like asking a pilot is a million gallons of fuels is a lot of gas he'd probably say no, but if you asked that same question to a race car driver he would say yes. More money equals bigger and nicer things.
Yeah that dude daves for real ........
Same
If you're judging this one week at a time you're doing it wrong and are part of the greater 'problem' he himself refers to in his admonition of supposed sideways movement. I said the word *investment* quite clearly. Now foh.
If someone is worrying about an investment return on a quarterly or bi annual basis they're closer to a trader than an actual investor. Indexes and stocks are volatile too obviously, unless a cataclysmic event happens or a crash unheard of, investors usually stand by and hold / accumulate.
Don't forget the starting product that makes doing something up possible!
lol
Or one negative one from $0. I'll go with that one.
Depends on who you compare them to. Because i Bought the dips and hodled.
Not in small markets, such as the GDP of Scotland.
Not at all. I short BTC and so linger around the boards to watch investor sentiment, plus try to warn folks who have very little in assets from wasting it on this stuff.
I hate ads, but I love Satoshis more.
True. It could potentially rise 1000%, but can always only go down 100%. Brb, gotta go invest everything I have in whatever.
More fun to short at 1200-1500 per pop. Easy money.
I think he means that most stocks are broadly correlated - Nikkei falls, the Dow falls, FTSE falls, although there is variation that is a broad tendency - this is statistical correlation. The gold price and individual currencies have a lower correlation. In terms of an individual or corporate portfolio having a basket of largely non-correlated assets tends to provide stability to that portfolio (i.e. one does well, 2 do badly 3 are ok).
so I should spend it, then rebuy it (so I don't lose gains)... how about, just don't spend it, then there's no chance of losing gains. you have to see how rediculous this circle jerk is.
I very much doubt the percentage for millionaires going broke is that high.
He did not admonish sideways movement, 'admonish' means to reprimand.  If you insist on using clever words - get them right :)

He was merely stating that sideways movement was not an encouragement.

And then you called him a fool.

And now, it seems, I too am 'doing it wrong' - a judgement you have made with zero knowledge of my portfolio or investments.

Take a break.  Maybe go and have an ice cream to calm down.


May I assume that 'foh' is rude? I rather think it is, there is no need for that in this forum. As BC... says, you clearly do not have a good grasp of the English language. I am not being rude, it is very probably not your first language so one makes allowances.
I would add that the plural of index is 'indices'.
eh?

How does that financial jabber - and that is what it is - justify you calling someone a fool?


Do you have an example of a regulation that would send BTC to $0?
What you are saying is not possible. What I said is probable.
Lol
?!?!

Oh you troller... you got me there.
After years I couldn't possibly tell you what Bitcoin will be worth a year from now but I'd defintiely say that based on escalating infrastructure and improvement, it will continue to be more. So what magical information source would you have to think you have credibility to advise someone not to invest in a rising technology?
Spending it will help increase adoption as retailers will see a greater need to offer bitcoin payments as an option. 

You have to start somewhere.

Your welcome

https://www.cleveland.com/business/index.ssf/2016/01/why_do_70_percent_of_lottery_w.html
Wow you're a whole different level of savage ain't you?  /s
 
 fr this is why I come back here so often rofl, ppl like you ;D
Fair enough 
"A 5% tax is hereby imposed on so-called cryptocurrency transactions."
One regulation away from $50,000 is probable?  Lol, ok guy. You must really think you're the smartest guy in the room and everyone is absolutely clueless if you really believe that. 
No shit!

Those clowns issuing Tether didn't get the memo.  They need to stop doing that and the price will get to $50k.
Is your cognitive dissonance like a constant ringing in your ears?
not if they have to be their own bank and monitor prices by the minute. missed a BRD or BGD and made a few btc transactions, oops, there goes a bunch of money for adjusting my prices on time. I just don't see it yet.
That's lottery winners.  
That would be a tax in the US I assume?  The network would continue to have utility for those outside the US, and they would support the price.

Also, it was kind of a trick question.  A $0 price isn't really achievable as long as one person is willing to pay a price above $0.  And the closer the price gets to 0, the less someone will care about a 5% tax when selling their bags would effectively translate into a 100% tax (or maybe closer to 70% tax when accounting for the deduction of losses).
Why bother with all the tax overheads.

The Morocco government just outright ban it.
Nope. But if you think it's impossible you must have just been born.
No such thing here. Learn about what Projection is and stop doing it.
In the early stages, retailers will use bitcoin payment conversion services like bitpay that immediately convert the bitcoin payment to fiat so that they don’t lose money. This is already happening.  I am already buying food and merchandise this way. 

As price becomes less volatile (it will take years for this to happen) then retailers will no longer need to rely on services like bitpay. They will be able to accept bitcoin directly without worrying about a BGD and BRD as these will no longer be happening.  Whales will have an extremely difficult time manipulating price as the masses will stabilize the system.  
So what do you think we will be when bitcoin moon. No matter how you look at it they are still millionaires. And they are people like me and you who have no idea what a million dollars is. A house alone is $250,000 (in CA)a lambo starts at $199,000 thats almost half. Dont get me wrong a million dollars is a good start but with today's economy a million dollars is easy to spend is all im saying. 
Impossible, nope. But I do think $2,000 is much more probable. 
Eh?
so buy btc with fiat, to use btc at at retail or that intern xfers back to fiat? why not just cut out the btc middle man and use fiat?
Yeah I hear you but the idea is to be sensible and it will last you a long time, I agree though that a lot of it depends on where you live and what sort of lifestyle you are used to.  I mean $1 million could keep a small village going for hundreds of years in certain parts of the world but in the very expensive parts of New York or London it's virtually nothing.
I know, it didn't make sense to me either
Because, paradigm shift. You just wouldn't understand. 
Because some of us here are actually trying to help increase adoption instead of just trolling a subreddit. 
Yea but you really have to think if you had a million dollars the avereage american would blow it. Thats why they tell you if you win the lottery hire a financial adviser and lawyer, because we dont realize how little a million dollars is. 
what does a Korn album have to do with BTC?
Paradigm shift ... lol :)

I haven't used that cliche for awhile.  

Nah, it's a Digital Transformation.
Idk
