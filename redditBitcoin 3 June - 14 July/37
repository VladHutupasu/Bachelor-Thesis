Daily Discussion, June 08, 2018 -- TITLE
This is me in a nutshell ever since I found out about bitcoin:

**Come On Bulls!**
market volume zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz......
Checked the date, it's 2 days since June the 6th. 28 days remaining till July the 6th.
June 8th and sitting at 7500. Consensus and the  institutional money meme
I am waiting to see the lowest volume btc market can reach...
I'm great at buying low but suck at selling high
paxful = best p2p platform in the game
7500...hi again my old friend.
Am I right in saying there aren't any lighting enabled BTC wallets for Android that allow you to receive payments as well as send?
Alts just went to shit. Why can’t bitcoin just go back 15000 in the next couple of months :-:
Just for kicks, I'm predicting the volume will drop even lower for the next little while... couple  of days.
Lightning rolling out nicely:

How much longer must we endure this torture?  Who the hell keeps selling large amounts throughout the night................
If two whales try to manipulate price with selling back and forth wouldn't they eventually lose some coins as third parties buy parts of their orders?
There’s always one person in this thread that’s spot on about predictions. Not the same person but someone is always spot on.
This isn’t bear or bull. It’s horse. As in shit 
Looking good for a significant rise in next 24 hrs.

LN news is excellent.

Bcashers are in a mess trying to understand where they went so badly wrong.

Altcoins have no response.
Absolutely no will to go up.
Welcome to the world of pumping by margin funding...

I don't know if you people noticed, but margin funds at Bitfinex almost dried out during this week.

Epic.
Exactly
Better than picking one or a couple of 1500 alt coins 
Sloooooowly drop your fiat ... and calmly ... step away ... from the Bitcoin. 
Why is volume dropping but price increasing? 
I just discovered the 'Raw tx' app

looks good, might be something in the direction what we need for the average user.
Bulls do not have the strength.
It will not be anything anymore this year
Lol
It's 10k, It's 10k, It's 10k, Here's some dipper and LSD..now look at it...see it??

**Which Way? Bitcoin's Low Volatility May Force Big Move**

https://www.coindesk.com/which-way-now-low-bitcoin-price-volatility-may-force-breakout/

Bitcoin has been squeezed into an increasingly narrow range for more than two weeks and is now experiencing volatility not seen for eight months.

As a result, it's looking likely that bitcoin could soon make a strong move, but the direction it will take when that happens is less than clear. Since May 24, the cryptocurrency has been restricted to a range of $7,000–$7,800 range, which is already very tight, but the price has barely moved in the last 36 hours, likely indicating an indecisive market.

Daily volatility, as indicated by the spread between the daily price high and daily price low, fell to $107.63 on Thursday – the lowest level since Oct. 2, 2017 and down 86 percent from the 2018 average of $793, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).

As of writing, prices on CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) are at $7,580, marking around a $100 drop over 24 hours.

View

A move above $7,819 (50-week moving average) would signal a bullish breakout and would set the tone for a rally to pennant resistance located at $8,880.

On the downside, a break below $7,090 (pennant support) would imply a bearish breakdown. In this case, BTC could potentially drop below $6,000 (Feb low).
pretty big volume flowing in not much $ movement? loading up before pump?
 **Bitcoin Will Hit $25K by End of Year, Fundstrat's Lee Says**   he forgot the , between the 2 and the 5 its 2,5 k...
bitcoin and alts ...its over...dont invest you will lose evrything
BTC will not go beyond 10-15k USD for 1.5 - 2 years.

The powers that be are doing their thing and suppressing it.

Watch...

Edit:  I've been here for for 5 years.  You people are not getting lambos.

You're nuts.

Keep downvoting.
Well this is boring

Hi Folks, dying of cancer here, got a few months left if lucky.   I have a 0.2 BTC to sell for CAD... sent to my real bank account.  The thing is I am having a real tough time trusting anything, most want a sign-up, some have a couple of ways to sell/exchange/offer, very confusing..  I little light in something, one shot, simple and anonymous would be nice. or something thereabouts.
You have it backwards. If you did more work then you would have more money to buy more crypto. 
The Bitcoin community needs to sponsor this person and buy him/her some Bitcoin pom-poms because he/she is here cheering and excited about Bitcoin every day. Also, what is good for Bitcoin is good for all crypto so there is that.
Coming!  Snort.
Once the trend has been spotted by the masses, the trend changes. 
when institutional money meme ultra mega super quadro turbo moon?
Yep I've been startled by just how low the volume is on the exchanges. It does keep getting pushed up every time it drops though.
Be fun to see if I sold all my holdings I could affect the price :)

I reckon I could change the 5 minute candle by a tad.
No worries.

Wow.

Atomic swaps.  

LN advancing at an alarming pace.

This demo, in case you missed https://satoshis.place/

(I particularly like the stagnant turd with Bcash pointed at it.  Suck on that Roger-coiners.)


Volume is irrelevant.
It's high right now, up over a thousand percent in less than 2 years. You can still lock in your gains from buying low if you sell now.
lol
Except this time we’re not friends anymore. I hate this guy now. 
try CTRL+ALT+Delete
'tis the finest wankcoin available, and apparently being botted here :)
You'll endure this "torture" for as long as you think it is a torture. This situation sits perfectly OK with me. I of course would enjoy a rally, but I don't care about the volatility and slow seasons. This little season is actually pretty encouraging since Bitcoin has been consistently defining higher bottoms.
I'm starting to think that 2018 is going to keep doing this to us.  This guy gives me hope but he's been wrong already this year.

**Bitcoin Will Hit $25K by End of Year, Fundstrat's Lee Says**

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne0qsJH7vv0

Jun.06 -- Tom Lee, Fundstrat Global Advisors managing partner, discusses the outlook for cryptocurrencies with Bloomberg's Scarlet Fu and Julie Hyman on "Bloomberg Markets."
Dude relax. Go sell your rent money and get out of the game. Don't invest what you can't afford to lose. The price of Bitcoin may go down in the short term but it will definitely rise long term. If you think this 700% gains from a single asset in a year is torture then crypto ain't for you. Hodling will pay off but it takes massive financial balls because it always crashes because of people like you. No offense.
Night where?
Yes, you can see this happening as the lows get higher and the highs get lower. This likely means a lot of the new money (6 months or less) is stuck in this wave of value (6k to 19k) and waiting for the next wave of new money to bring it past 19k. Some of these people will sell and some will hodl. How far past the price goes is anyone's guess but I bet it will come back down again and the clock will reset at a higher price than 20k. By resetting the clock I mean that we will have newer hodlers but at a much higher value. This has been the case since the beginning of Bitcoin and the past isn't always indicative of the future and blah blah you know what else.
What you're suggesting is that it is impossible to manipulate a market indefinitely without eventually losing out, and that is true.

If it were not true, there would not have been markets of one form or another for thousands of years.


I dont think they have to actually sell coins to manipulate the matket. They put in buy and sell orders which raises or lowers the price of btc. I think. But us little people are trying to get rich quick thats why and how the whales are able to manipulate the market. #hodl
so, all I have to do is figure out which one is right each time and I'll be rich... easy
I think you are about 50% correct there.  But on the other hand, maybe not.
This is Bitcoin on mood stabilizers.
Well, the alts are crushing BTC in the only point that matters - price.

Among the Top 5 coins, BTC is the worst performing (daily and weekly).
I guess we don't really know what's going to happen until we're at 500-ish.
Edit: Or @ 7.250?
This is what happens when you get rejected by a major sell wall twice in a row
Marginal trading is just the stupidest thing one can do at this market. Exchange can easily manipulate the market with such low volume.
Yet you forget the green dildo at 7.1k still holds.
BTC is not digital gold - it is better.

You can't sell gold.

Seriously.  If I gave you 1 kg of gold, I challenge you to sell it.

You can't (or rather, you can, at a 50% loss.)

Lol 
[deleted]
I was thinking that.
.. Ooh Sir, but surely you are tempting me with your shitcoin :)
That’s the “bear market incoming” signal
Price goes up $100 "Bitcoin going to a million!" Price goes down $100 "Bitcoin going to zero!"

The sentiment around here is absurd and seems highly driven by coordinated activity to exacerbate the pumps and dumps. 
That's pretty pessimistic.
Wait where are the institutional investors, BTW
Yeah, I know what you mean.
Q5 2018
T-10

Yesterday. Sorry you mist it m8.
Who writes this stuff? The price of Bitcoin has been stable. So naturally this means it's going to go up, or down, a whole bunch. 
I presume you are joking about the big volume?
Interesting, your name has "moon" on it and you're a FUD troll. That's a contradiction!
He was saying 35K last month ..hmm
If it hits that in 2018 then you will think Tom Lee is a g-d. If it hits that in 2019, what, he is a hack? Cut the cards however you want, Tom Lee is a Bitcoin bull and he definitely has the right vision whether or not his time table comes true. He will be rewarded for his insight. I guarantee it.
Jupp, so why are you here?
come on guys! Blond_With_Tits has been a redditor for a day... listen to him!  He know about "the powers that be".
I’ve been here 5 years, said the guy who’s been here 1 day.
If you've been here 5 years, you will know that it is completely impossible to make predictions like yours surrounding the price of BTC.

You might be right - but you simply don't know.

It seems that in those 5 years you have learned nothing.
I dont think it will go over 9980. We saw last time what it did at 9990. So everyone sets a limit that is lower than the last limit just to recover losses from january as much as possible and leave for at least a year and then try again.
You have edited a highly contentious post.

It is good manners, and a forum expectation, to provide a brief note and explanation for your edit(s).


I heard the SEC was looking for manipulators. I think I found one right here, Mr. "Redditor for a day" making grand statements as usual.
I've been on this sub for 8 years, but who's counting?
I’ll upvote you 
I will be very happy if it stays there for the next 2 years. 
Sent u some bcash.....thats what u wanted right?

Cool idea, thanks for sharing, here's a free 0.1 BTC!
and...?
Yes, back to where it was 2 weeks ago.  Nice :P
You've just made something up there I'm afraid.

A bit like putting pineapple on a pizza, and calling it a pizza.
[deleted]
Use www.localbitcoins.com for local trades. If I was close, I'd buy it off you.
A few months is ample time to verify yourself with an exchange and convert to fiat, if that is your intention.

Alternatively, if you want to pass the BTC on to someone else, provide your seed words somewhere minus the last one or two words, and ensure the person you want to inherit only has those final parts to the seed.  It's not a huge sum, so probably no need for excessive security beyond that.

Short.
Nonsense.  You have a loud voice, but zero understanding.

Volume is everything in a market.


I’m on mobile :(
My portfolio is currently down 20%, even with a few significant wins in the altcoin world.  Feels like torture to me. 
Dude, stop relying on articles and go live your life. It will moon eventually, you're just torturing yourself by constantly thinking about it. Be a pro hodler and buy more whenever you can, it's cheap right now (you will wish you had bought more later)
Fool me once....  
It won’t crash because of me. I’m hodling.   
Then that means that price manipulation is good for bitcoin
Throttled volatility. Be grateful for the buying opportunity, miss it and you shall regret later :)
You know full well that they are always doing that, in a cycle.

The fact that TittyCoin is up 60% on the week is really of no significance, when it is down 65% the next week.

But if chaps like you can profit from it, good luck to you.

(But - you don't profit do you?  Because it is essentially gambling on horses you don't believe in.  I think you personally sold your BTC and went into alts, and you are watching your portfolio diminish.  That is why you are always here, looking for justification.)

I accept your challenge.  Show me the ~~money~~ gold.
I've always wondered about that.  Is there someplace you can go to actually trade your brick of gold for the actual dollar amount?  Like some reserve or bank somewhere?
Pretty much same with BTC. If you have 1,000,000 BTC you can only sell at 50% loss
-al
Thanks
You are on a sub for addicted gamblers. What did you expect?
If you see balance between these two kind of people then the price is right where it should be. If one group containsts more members, its going to be their way and shortly after that the oppsosite way.
nope you're wrong. panic due to straight lines not because of a dump or pump c:
OP is a known troll
I am not surprised if the bulls and the bears are the same, the trading platforms!! they manipulate the price and wait for everyone to receive their holiday allowance and go in. Always around May / June and November an increase every year again. so the little man burned
Will be arriving shortly after Chinese New Year.
People who understand markets.
Have a look at the link and it will tell you who wrote it.
biggest volume in the past three hours  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

\*5 hours
when 2,500.
He’s here to buy your coins after you sell 
he's right. we only come here for the memes...
I bet a lot of these FUD spreaders are actually people who are trying to get the price lower so they can buy it themselves. Why waste time otherwise? "For the memes"? As if people had that kind of time to waste.
The question is does “her” username check out?
I've been here that long and long enough to know most of your posts are worthless.

When I'm proven correct, I expect you will blow me...

Perhaps I know something you don't, genius.


You are a fool and won't be the first person that Bitcoin price surprises.
Bcash is still around? What’s wrong with them people! We are working on Lightning When Segwit is at 40%. Decentralization is key but slow. I don’t think I’ll live to see the world this technology has to offer. But as long as I see the change beginning and know he will have a better world, I can die in peace. 
Doing an awesome school project with my daughter. Here is my BTC address (please send me BTC). 


Oh, did I mention my daughter has cancer? 

Thank you!
You've lost a lot of money in alts.  Stop coming here hoping you didn't make a mistake.

Good advice.  Hadn't thought of that.

why does he need to provide seed words somewhere? can't he just give all the seed words to the person?
Because they're his? And maybe he wants do fucking do something before he dies? Holy shit 
I like salad.
Exactly.  I’m truly a wage slave. Bitcoin may be my only hope 
Bullish.
That's because you are a retard who don't understand the meaning of what I said.

Volume is irrelevant because more than 95% of BTC's trade volume is FAKE.
I’m down at least 50 because I bought in at ATH like a mug. 
Real torture would be selling that at a loss and then watching Bitcoin price spikes :)
i'm up like +50% on my "personal goal" since December. I'm down thousands though as a whole -shrugs-

I've lost quite a bit on NANO, but that's the only coin I hold eternally along with some smaller altcoins
buy the dip they said at 20k,19k,18k,17k,16k,15k,14k,13k,12k,11k,10k,9k,8k and now 7k, be careful about buying the dip and DCA :p
You're right but I can't seem to stop watching it.  
Well, no.

But in general, everything is **good for Bitcoin^TM**  :)
You have completely missed the point.  Your link tells me where to BUY it.


lol of course there is. Don't listen to this foolishness. I've held physical bullion of all denominations large and small and you can easily sell it back to the bank for market value. The only loss is the fee they charge you to authenticate that you're giving them real bullion and not hunks of lead. You wait a few days and when that's done your account is credited. 

Dunno what this guy is talking about "50% loss" that's absolute hogwash.
No.  See my comment above :)
**NO**
try to sell 1/21 of any currency all at once and see what happens

You're thinking of r/Bitcoinmarkets
Nice, you are one of the few who figured this out.

At some point (probably when the regulators clamp down), all that will be left are the ~~bag holders~~ moon worshipers.
I guess I was wrong 😂
People who understand markets stay away from Bitcoin. This is a market for rookie investors to get fleeced. 
surely you are not referring to the volume on GDAX
The above two comments absolutely nailed it.
Yes because spreading FUD in a reddit sub will cause that... lol

There's a lot of blond guys with tits around here, especially the trolls.
Do you really have to ask?
.. wrote the author of the completely worthless post at the top of this thread.
Says he's been around for 5 years. Has a one-day-old account......

Yeah that's not suspicious or anyting

What exactly is the point of making an account when you're just trying to get yourself banned?
Well when you have bests devs and top people in all fields from marketing to psychology to artists and finance, etc.... why would you direct people to another project. Cause you may not prefer bitcoin (you have to respect the people it has working on it), it’s going to be the standard on any future crypto project. When that project gets the unbelievable TALENT that is working on bitcoin, than you can complain about equal time for all others. 

I don’t understand how a project such as bitcoin is not good enough for the type of person you describing? 

The infrastructure and dedication and support from these people who could work on any project or for any company they want at any salary they want, is not enough sign to people of what the future is going to be because these devs are the ones who will create it. Microsoft wants this talent so bad it bought GitHub for millions hoping to lure even a few to work for them. 


Get out of his brain dude.
Well, if I had been trading in alts, I would be doing much better than anyone dealing with BTC since it's been the worst performing among the top 5 coins.
cool.
Well I suppose you could.
I wish people like you would stop using terms like 'retard.'

It is pretty offensive to someone with learning difficulties; and is also completely off target and meaningless when directed at me.

Learn some manners and style.
Yes that's double torture.
True. 
You fucking retarded and can't navigate a simple website?

https://www.bullionstar.com/sell/

How do you think they run their business?  Just like any forex dealers - trading on spread.
like any bank?  If I walk into my corner Citibank with a brick of gold I can get cash?
Ignorant redneck.
These subs are all the same. No one cares about the "technology". They are just degenerate gamblers that want to get rich.
How much did you leverage?
Please, assert your superiority. 
You would be surprised.
🤮
Lmao 
Depends on how hot “she” is 😜
Watch, genius.

I know things you and others here do not.

...and, yes, you are a tool.
What the hell did that mean? 


Will do.  Thx.
- and yet - you give no timescale.

Ergo.  

Meaningless.
But it is not bought by them at anywhere close to the market price.

How is your altcoin portfolio doing?

I foolishly put about 5% of my BTC portfolio into promising shitcoins 1 year ago - and they have all underperformed.

I am, very far, from being a retard btw.
I haven't sold to multiple banks, only the bank which I've purchased from. But most major banks I know of have precious metal services where they buy/sell gold bullion. Not every branch handles this but if you bring it to a branch that doesn't they ship it to the one that does (also for a small fee).

If you walk into a bank that offers these services with a kilogram of gold bullion they will gladly purchase it from you. They'll also sell you a kilo of gold if you want as well. Or a half kilo. or 10oz. bar. or 5oz bar or 1oz ingot, or half oz. or 1/20oz 'chip'. etc. There's all types. 
Heh.  I wish it were sunnier here.

Do your taxis still go 'ping ping'?
One who buys a large amount of Bitcoin without understanding the technology is simply doing it wrong.
More like they're all idiots who invested far more than they can afford and come here 1087696 times a day to complain about it
Heh.
'Blow me'. 'tool' - I know something you don't ..

You have a schlong fixation :)
...Screeched the tool
I wish I was 15 again
Ooh look, magic circle scammer [/u/phillybitcoinconsult](https://reddit.com/u/phillybitcoinconsult) is back at it.
Wrong again.  The acceptable trading margin is 0.3% spread on spot.

You said gold can't be sold and you were just proven to be dead wrong.  This itself shows that you are just a novice when it comes to investing.

Now stop making a fool of yourself.


I dunno where this "can't buy/sell Gold" FUD comes from.

Gold spot prices are public and there are plenty of retailers that will buy/sell solid gold coins, bars, etc.  Yeap, it's quite cool carrying 1kg gold bars and walk around :)

Here's one in Singapore where I live - 

https://www.bullionstar.com
I'm sorry.  But .. Bollox :)
I generally agree, but the "without understanding the technology" part is a bit redundant.
Who is the better person? The one who comes to complain about losing money, or the one who comes to the place people come to complain about losing money to complain about people who come to that place to complain about losing money?
Most people who come here seek to reassure themselves that the situation is going to get "better".
https://youtu.be/IetaaBPtS6I?t=98
Heh (2)
Not at all. In fact you can call any branch that offers bullion services and they’ll walk you through the process. 

Not sure why you’re so out of the loop on this...
I hadn't heard that, thanks. I'll listen to the whole album this weekend.
O.K.

Send me a link to a bank in Europe where I can walk in and sell my 1kg of gold please - AT MARKET PRICE.

Wanker :)
You know what, genius?  I was downvoted for 3 years (another account) for having the audacity to suggest things were being manipulated.

Now, it's being investigated.

I am now telling everyone things are being suppressed by the powers that be.

Watch.
You are just an ignorant redneck who don't have the grace to admit to being wrong on such a simple matter.

Physical gold is traded in retail stores around the world.

Get over it, moron.
WTF do I know about Europe? I don't live in Europe. If you want to find a bank that offers those services there then do your own research.

I'm not your secretary, fool.


maybe take a deep look inward, maybe you were downvoted because you act like a douche
watch my ass!!!
Actually, I upvoted you.  We're a nice crowd here.

Heh.
Touchy :)

Get me a cup of tea please.
Watching.  What's it gonna do?
You have no idea what my username was.
Weak trolling is weak. 
whatever, [/u/phillybitcoinconsult](https://reddit.com/u/phillybitcoinconsult), go back to ms paint you troll.
