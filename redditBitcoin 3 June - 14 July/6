[Bitcoin \(BTC\) To Be Worth $100 Million Per Coin By 2030](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-btc-worth-100-million-081919306.html)

[Binance has begun to embrace the memes.](https://ibb.co/mwi1K8)

This is extremely bullish.
"listen to me now, believe me later"

buy BTC
lol wtf is this?
Abolish the fed, am I right guys? Because fiat?
HODL!!!
I think we about to give this another shot soon lets go!!!!
Creepy price to level off at.
Segwit transactions just broke a new all time high 39.4%
The one year anniversary of Segwit activation is in August, I'd love to see us at 50% by then.

Even this is 40% which is just amazing.

$6,666.66 at one point today, what an unlucky price
Bull exhaustion!  Don't give me that bullshit, they have done fuck all for the last 7 or so months! 
Ok so full disclosure I bought bitcoin in 2017 right when the it’s over 9000 memes hit the front page. I bought in at $9,100. I sold right before it crashed at around $15,200. I’m not gonna lie to you, I forgot about bitcoin after I sold and saw the trend turning super bearish. I didn’t think about getting back in until I saw a bitcoin meme on /all yesterday. I’ve been doing basic research just looking at the price history charts for bitcoin. I noticed that at many times throughout its history, bitcoin has fallen around 69-71% at most between ATH and the lowest point following the recovery from said ATH. You can look up the charts and see the same thing. I’m not saying you should be excited but every time it hit -70ish percent after a crash it *always* went back up to a new ATH. We went from around $19,343 to a low of around $5,800 recently. I’m not saying you should be bullish but in my opinion (which shouldn’t mean shit) bitcoin is already going to go on the up and up. Based on the fact that throughout its history whenever it went to a low of -71% it went back up. Just throwing that out there. Want to know what you guys think.

Things were going so well....

What happened? Seems like every time we get a rally, it gets completely erased a few days later. 
Just sold some altcoins for BTC at a loss, gonna try to trade altcoins to recover the $6500 I put in, currently portfolio is worth $1600, wish me luck 
I feel pretty optimistic about Bitcoin currently . Yes things look bad again all currencies have experienced the same. Let's not panic people. 
Bitcoin is going to pick up. 
Not particularly, and the BTC prices are much better
Break that 6800 wall hiiiyaaaaaaa!
I love when my favorite alt gives me more BTC, now just need BTC to increase my potential fiat value.. but i'm honestly in it for the tech...  but who doesn't want greens?

Apparently, the perma-bulls seem to have the better crystal ball in this game.  When you are out shopping for crystal balls, choose wisely.

>Both camps are acting as shamelessly as each other.

>The perma-bulls are encouraging late-comers to pile in north of $1000, which is far more risk than most of us accepted. And the perma-bears are stoking Armageddon-type paranoia to propel a sell-off, which will stop many existing holders from profiting. You're all acting like financial advisors, when in reality most of you probably know fuck all about financial markets. The mainstream media and newbie investors might take bitcoin a bit more seriously if you'd get off your high-horses and have a bit of damn humility.

>Having an opinion is good. Discussing your opinion in a calm, reasoned and constructive way is really good - it can help people develop their understanding of what is still a *very* experimental and uncertain technology. But pretending you have a crystal ball and encouraging people to risk money on the back of propaganda is fucking douchey.

Bitcoin (BTC): Another Big Bull Run is Coming

&nbsp;

>In conclusion, the decline of BTC and the crypto markets seem to have been abated by the recent signs of progress exhibited by regulatory clarity; Coinbase Custody services; the ETF application by the CBOE; and the Australian government partnering with IBM. This means that the future is bright for not only BTC but the entire crypto markets.

And we shall rise beyond 7k. watch the space. this is temporal 
Moon? Lambo? when?
Goodbye 6.7K it was nice you tried your best. Weekend will destroy us.
Which bitcoin reddit has all the memes?
Many Bitcoin TA experts on twitter are talking about a bearish divergence today, however they say it's a good thing! Because then buyers will jump in and boost the price up further.
Drop a check this week or na? I missed the 5900 bull run RIP
Looks like 6,700 might be breaking
ok maybe i could get some pointers, doing my part here.   downloaded testnet node and synced, downloaded latest full node and synced.  Can I run both at the same time ?   and how do i tell if its running?  noob at the node!
Well this is boring
Haven't checked the price in days, I want to guess it through your sentmentssss
We have activity 
[removed]
Positive Vibes. 
**COME ON BULLS!** 
[What ever you do, don't blame the Bears!](http://m.memegen.com/mhux78.jpg)
And we're going back down 5k here we come again see you guys there 
Is 6.7 our ceiling?
So they introduced the Beyond Meet burger today in A&W (burger joint all across Canada). It's surprising good and really does taste like beef. 
Why don't the Bulls push today? 
Yes.
What are the feelings when u wanna a pump, but turns out to be a huugge dump?
Lots of institutional money coming in, guys! 
I just got off the phone with my stock broker friend and he said that a LOT of institutional money is going to be unleashed tomorrow morning. Most institutional stock investors are waiting to see how the levels hold above 6k and since they have been doing well, we can expect several hundred million coming in per day. I can't say where my friend works (except in a few years they might change their name to bitcoinman sax lol) and they have TONS of investors just in their one department that are liquidating their old-school investments (stocks, bonds, CDs, and mutual funds) and going ALL IN on crypto. I talked to him about bcash and he said that nobody on his team was going to invest in it since it's a huge scam by the traitor roger ver, and most people were interested ONLY in bitcoin.

Edit: He also said that a LOT of people in the industry are upset with Jamie Diamond because he was hurting cryptocurrencies. Luckily the board of JP Morgan Chase & Company is considering replacing him with a friendly bitcoin CEO. Stay tuned and I will let you know when I have more information.

Edit 2: Downvote all you want, bcashers, it doesn't change anything.
I'm waiting for the volume to hit zero.

Anyone else watch this guys channel? not a lot of subscribers but I am biased towards his opinions. Maybe a bit of an echo chamber? thoughts? 
Yesterday I bought btc and nbox. I may be buying more... check out unboxed network, worth a chance! 
I wanted to buy some more but then it spiked to 6.7K. 
>England winning the world cup

Please don't. My heart can't take it. 
McAfee : Is my dick safe?????
Lol, at our current rate more like 2023
 2030 LOL
*Funds are saifu*
It’s pkaying with my damn emotions is what it IS 
I think it was a premature boost, we about to get the real one soon
Ron Paul nonsense, aisle 5.
Nope, its a bull trap. Bitcoin will reach a new low within the month
Hah, I'm not the only one who saw that.

In China 6 is a lucky number 
Not if you're a Devil worshiper! 
Previous performance and trends are not a guarantee of future performance and trends but .... I'm hodling on anyway.
First time bitcoin buyer here. I've been buying small amounts of bitcoin of which I'm willing to lose since it was around $9000. I researched it for a while before I decided to start investing. Nobody really knows where this is going, but if I wasn't investing this money, I would be spending it on some bullshit or something. I do have high hopes for it, though. Our currency is built on built on quicksand and I like where crypto is going. I'm going to keep holding and dropping a couple hundred dollars in when I can. Let's see where this thing goes.
I held through the fall mainly because I didn't want to pay short term gains since I bought most at 3000. Strangely my breakeven point is around $6500 where we have been hovering for quite some time lately. 
Why the fuck does past history indicate future forecasts? The market is completely different now
...over 9000 memes...oh god, so much vegeta...
It also says that Tron (1982 film) has a 4300% growth in interest!
Revenge trading is the fastest way to lose what you have left. Keep a cool head
Good luck man.  You don’t need to do all that though.  Just hold coins and run with the People’s money 
Here are some really swell altcoins -- http://deadcoins.com
I just invested into Bitcoin for the first time and my Outlook is positive!
Don't you find it a bit hazardous?
Not even close atm...
What does in it for tech mean if it doesn’t mean that you’ll eventually receive a good payday from good tech creating good results?
Dude just stop
I just care about snowflakes!
I like it
Im starting to feel a breeze, time to spread dem wings
yes it wil rise up
Tomorrow. For sure.
/r/btc is the biggest joke
Lol at "BTC TA experts".
pamp it
🤡
What do you think it is?
bye 6.7k
So, you have the u/gloriakami2595 account also? 

:D
I saw it as well lol. 
call us when you get there so we know you're safe
Dunno about yours but mines plasterboard 👍
Because
You've been time-travelling again, haven't you?
Oh, about the same as it has been about twice a month since February.
Ok Mr Wunderbaah, the quilt guy. 
[deleted]
It's spelled Goldman Sachs, not Sax. Maybe you should pay closer attention to where this insider friend of yours purportedly works.

Edit: His name is Jamie Dimon, not Diamond. Jesus, how can you pretend to have connections to the finance industry and not even get these things right?
Makes me feel good forgoing debt payments to but more bitcoin :))
Looks like poop
 looks like interesting poop.
Looks interesting
Oh man, a big flurry of activity and we're still at 6.7k... do something! :P
oh yah, this boost is great. 
no one has said this every day since january.
Hopefully we stay above that forever
Gilfoyle.gif
It doesn’t. That’s why I asked what you guys think. I don’t think it can go lower than 5k before going on another bull run 
That’s the one that got me to buy lol. I had heard of bitcoin before but never actually thought about getting my feet wet in the space. But what do you think about the ATH crashes then recovery to new ATH? Just a coincidence or a trend one should pay attention to? 
You mean the people that are reading this?
But those are all dead
And your Excel?
Yes
Come on, it's 67xx so it's very close.

But it's interesting that 6800 is a some sort of resistance level.  There is no technical nor psychological basis.  

7k, I can understand.  6.8 is like a random number.
Well that is what it means, the field I work in is already experimenting with industry 4.0, the biggest companies in the world will soon be exposed to working products of blockchain, machine learning and iot that will be directly applicable to their whole business without much change. so yeah, i'm in it for the tech. the tech is here to stay because it is changing businesses for the better.
Stop spreading the truth?  

Hmmm... no. 😛
He said that it would be 19000 by November. Ummkay.
This daily isnt far behind
Huhhh
6710, 6880 without sentmentss
Little man I will come through this screen and pull your asshole out through your taint 
Same old thing over and over again, gets past 6800 and then drops :( 
Oh, that must be nice having a real plasterboard ceiling. I live in the woods. 
Haha you’re literally the worst 
You must be bored
*Doomp eet again*
I don't know who that is, but do you know where I can buy a new quilt with LN? I need to get cozy.
I don't invest myself, but I am well connected with the big Bay Street players.
This part i think is manipulation, booster coming soon
We're already below it
Oh ok sorry. I think you're right
Buy the dip, man! All I see are cheap coins.
Kind of like my Word, fully functional.
Have you been time travelling again?
I thought we already beat them on this.

Half the posts here are nothing but BS claims on price up/down.
The other half are nutcases proclaiming the end of governments, banks and fiat.

Bitcoin: $6803

Feels like: $8205
Oh man, way off dude, we're at $11,500 lol
lol
Lmao
I’m not worried 
6850 is the number we need and must stay above 
Heh, just two months ago folks were anguishing about BTC getting back to 8000. And two months from now, probably the same stress just to get back to 6000.
The woooorrrrsssttttt!
Lol, didnt you help your mom setting up a lightening node because her favourite quilt store is accepting bitcoin now ? 
You are well connected with your dogs anus

It's surprising you frequent a bitcoin subreddit, state connection with said investors,  and state you don't invest yourself.    Just an observation,  did I interpret what you said properly? 
Oh, right, right... ;-)
If it goes to 5k it will have fallen around 74% from its ATH. I think that if we go by past trends (which are not indicative of future results) we can feel comfortable with investing around that price. 
Lol there is far more room for these worthless digital currencies to fall
Glad to hear:)
Wait a dang minute...
That's what crypto is all about.
Me when I bought at 2k, sold at 5k, and it sky rocketed to 20k in a month. 
Lol
Wow. Not sure if me in the past, or you in the future!
I'm not either but I wish we could have some really positive action.
I don't invest in the stock (scam) market. Crypto all the way.
Institutional money about to pour in!
Just gotta keep buying the dips all the way down, kinda like bitcoin.
 porque no los derp?
Kinda sounds like you're worried a little maybe
Just lol
