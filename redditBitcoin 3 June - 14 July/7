Daily Discussion, July 08, 2018 -- TITLE
Anyone think we will go up more today?
Positive Vibes. 
Open, borderless, neutral, and censorship resistant

I want Antonopoulusisms on flash cards.  I always enjoy watching his videos, they get me pumped up about the future of bitcoin.  
Closing the weekly on top of the candle and golden cross upcoming on 4h, the last time we had that was 3 months ago where from we made a $2k move up. Ofcourse there are a dozen arguments against this logic but the sentiment last weeks seems there is less potential for downside. 

If next week manages to break through this $6.8K-$7k resistance we can test the 50 week MA again.

In other words, next week will be quite interesting.
CoinMarketCap is reporting wrong values again for certain exchanges (BTC/USDT on Binance at 7K already [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/#markets](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/#markets))  


What would you guys suggest is the best alternative to CoinMarketCap?
I wonder how darknet markets are doing? They used to be a big thing when i first got into BTC but then FBI iirc took the biggest one down. Is there still alot of activity there? Are they using BTC or something else?
Daily Hopium:


Well, this guy was one year off in his prediction, but he was basically right.  And as usual, the crash trolls were calling him crazy.   

Now that we are nearing the end of our latest bubble/bear market cycle, the question is, how high will the next bubble take us?   30k?  100k?  350k?   Good luck everyone!  🙂🤘

(Excerpts)

I know this, bitcoin hasn't moved in a stable predictable rise yet, and there's no reason to think it will start now. It has moved in exponential bursts, each preceded by a pessimistic retraction period.

This will be the sixth such time we have done so, and we are growing increasingly efficient at it.

I want you to go ahead and start thinking about what you will do, and how you will act when the 'unthinkable' occurs. Because the unthinkable is always right around the corner.

Wisdom is recognizing that history repeats itself, and there's nothing new under the sun.

Wealth is the end result of taking a calculated risk based off your acquired wisdom.

I sold after our most recent bull run at around 8500, bought back in at around $6500 was able to afford 2 BTC now without adding any Fiat thanks to the bear run, now let's ride Bulls!
And we're off again.

Remember I called it last time .. 
Saw some interesting stuff at a job fair today in Korea. Basically they need to fill some serious positions like computer programmer and Dapp dev, but they will only do it on a Sunday afternoon in a tiny isolated building. Then they won't pay more than $3k/month....

[https://thenews.asia/2018/07/08/korean-blockchain-industry-desperate-for-talent-wont-pay/](https://thenews.asia/2018/07/08/korean-blockchain-industry-desperate-for-talent-wont-pay/)
I have a question for anyone who may know. Does anyone know if the new Coinbase Pro solve any issues with instant buy of crypto? My BBT linked account is still taking an “instant” 10 days. I’ve removed and added the account several times without any resolution to this problem. 

Hell if anyone has a recommendation for an app similar to Coinbase that is currently instant and would allow one to buy and send crypto that would be great!

Let's do an observation - BITCOIN +
The current gaming model and + 10 years ago.

Before, we used to go to recreational halls where in groups/alone play (retro). The pricing strategy was different and the more time, the higher score, the more value the user was generating... When at some point was even able to export that value from the recreational halls by exchanging it for a toy, console or other valuable items.

Now recreational halls are 4, steam-ubisoft-origin-epicgames (centralisation - power).

 I'm that type of user who got into computers because of gaming, and then I got into crypto because of computers. And I'm here to discuss about the current situation in the gaming industry... What a scam! We are being scammed everyday, and we have been used to this fraud that we don't even realize it..😠

Nowadays, if you want to experience an ultimate game you have to pay for everything!! 

Value transference:
Game == pay 🚮
Skins == pay🚮
DLC == pay🚮
Bonus == pay🚮


But then, once you have used skins and want to sell it to export the value from the game there is no option. Games not only offer you the gaming experience, they also track data from your GPU, preferences, inputs...
This data has a value, and they are not giving you value for it, they are charging you!

Gaming platforms don't give you the right to have the full game, instead the give you a licence to use the game under certain conditions (usually to avoid cheats, but usually.). For more info read the steam terms and conditions.

This crappy and disgusting situation has made me wake up and fight against this industry 🙌. And the best weapon to fight is Bitcoin. Since several months I have been working in a platform powered with microtransactions via LN ⚡ where:

✓ Users get paid while/for gaming.
✓ Users can extract value from the gaming platform.
✓ Users can choose a charity if they don't want the money they earn while gaming.
✓ Users have the control over the gaming industry and not the opposite.

After months of following my dream I'm so close to finally release it! 

 No gambling, Fuck ICOs & Fuck Scams
I'm in China, and a foreigner. How can I buy bitcoins?
6.7k resistance is so fucking strong!!! Arghh!!!! :S

this is a show me and g/f worked on hope you enjoy
Am I the only one thinking that BTC """mass""" adoption, if it happens too fast (before most people on Earth get how it works and why i could be trusted, or doesnt need to be trusted), could leads to civil war ?   


I mean, we're clearly early adopters, and most of us give more trust to cryptocurrencies than fiat. But reality is our society is still built on fiat currencies relations. Adopting any crypto could, in my opinion, leads to people to stop trusting their fiat, and create (with other financial reasons that i dont master) the biggest financial crisis we ever had. It could be even worst.   
My point : not enough peoples are aware of HOW crypto works, HOW to use it, and WHY use it. Also, our all society is built on a relation between fiat and power. 
#ViresInNumeris
I think these daily discussions are infiltrated by Ver trolls. Watch these people y’all. This discussion spreads more FUD than anything posted online. 
How come some exchanges report wrong prices? Isn't that illegal?
Have the shorters given up for now?  Don't see all the redditors for two weeks fostering ill will and claiming bitcoin is dead today.
Hello there, I'm a new reddit user and have a question that I'm sure that many people do ask. How does one start to actually invest in crypto currency? Not bitcoin per se but in general? Thank you to anyone that does respond and help me out.
is crypto dead
Guys a security question. Do you store your coins in just one wallet, or do you have a few just in case something happens to one of those?
im not big on prices but cryptowatch just showed btc at 6666 last sell off.  is that the mark of the beast? haha i guess we're in the depths of hell with no where to go but up?
I'm still waiting for a transaction that was sent 2 hours ago and it has 31% confidence level, should i be worried
SELL!!!

I think it can touch the sky 
I'm hoping Catamaran with room for a Lamborghini on deck! 
6.9k in a few hours. And remember, you heard it here first.
Cryptocurrency prices are primed for a breakout. The political situation worldwide coupled with all the uncertainties around the globe are all signs, telegraphing an eminent crypto surge.
Nah. Sundays and Mondays are kinda ho-hum.
+ vibes
my confusion just hit new hights
That man keeps it so real it causes 3rd degree VC burns.
i agree. 6.8k is a major resistance. if we break it and consolidate above it for a little while, the bull run will officially start.

If you use Binance then the Binance app is accurate haha
Serious question, how do you find those old comments. 
So, you think we can expect a dump tomorrow? 
Pump on low volume, dump on high volume. Sunday is usually a good run-up day because the trading is so light.
$3k/month is pretty much average pay in Korea.
stop it with the asian talk. what are you ? a ten ?
You had me until you smack talked Carlos. That’s crossing the line. 
have you tried paxful? 
Localbitcoins ?
dude, most people are not even aware how money works.
what? no, not for these reasons.

cryptocurrency and its distributed ledger technologies are supposed to power the stock market and the bond market and the real estate market

DTCC is supposed to be replaced with a blockchain. or DTCC uses a blockchain.

the end user isn't supposed to know anything. it wouldn't case a financial crisis.
You would be surprised how many people here have no clue about even the basics of Bitcoin and blockchain. Barely anyone here can explain the relation between Bitcoin and the blockchain let alone the importance of decentralization in the whole thing.
I’m not sure how bad it could get, but I do think people who cling to their fiat while the majority of the world begins to switch to crypto will see their fiat value decrease substantially.  This will definitely piss those people off. 
Reads as 

"Please use hardware wallets to secure your assets"
The prices are indeed wrong. CMC shows binance USDT/BTC pair as 7K. 
The markets price may vary. Why do you say that? Can you give us a screenshot?
I always had the impression not all the data were commonly visible HA HA HA
The exchanges themselves are reporting the correct price, it's just indexing sites like CoinMartetCap that are reporting wrong prices for certain exchanges for some reason.
illegal? lol. price is whatever you pay. you choose to pay more, that's on you.
Too high or too low?
I was just going off of other comments in the Daily Discussion. Chill guys
Not sure how it could be illegal anyway.  It is an unregulated industry.  What do our legal scholars say on this?
Wrong prices?...
They're all busy frantically closing their short positions. 
Well, faith is stronger than beliefs!
Honestly a lot of people will knock it on here, but Coinbase is a really solid starting point. 

It doesn't offer true ownership of crypto but it does let you trade and it's super simple to use. If you're looking to start into crypto, it's a good way to get comfortable before getting serious. 
[deleted]
Crypto is so dead man that's why big exchanges re making so much money and investing in making their platforms better 
No it's not.  
Yes. Now leave 
Best to have multiple wallets. Hardware wallets such as Trezor and paper wallets (generated offline) for long term storage.
Only 69% worried…
NOOOOOOOOOO!!
We are working on doing everything in our power to make sure this doesn’t happen. 
Bitcoin bull here. There is no growth artificial enough for Bitcoin perma-bulls. 

Up 10x in one year? "Why is it going down for a while?"

Up 3x in one year? "Why is it going up so slow?! Go faster!"

I have a theory that a lot of early Bitcoin investors will kill themselves when they're rich old fucks who wasted their youth looking at charts.

well, until and unless , bigger players start holding on to the coins over a longer period of time...Bitcoin price will keep coming down
You mean the 1% drop? Relax..
Wtf r u talking about? R u serious. It’s up to $6700
and then we can all fly.....
:)
few hours meaning days or weeks lol
I hope you're right, I wish it would hurry up and get to over $10k atleast.
read ‘telegraphing eminem’. thought this guy knows.
Bullish. Shit.
Idk why you guys are talking about resistance. This whole run up has been a series of pumps and nothing more, nothing organic about it. The price rises until the pump stops and then it holds steady until the next pump. 
[https://www.coindesk.com/price/](https://www.coindesk.com/price/) finds the average price among popular exchanges
I just use the search function to search the r/Bitcoin Reddit.  I generally plug in keywords often used today like “delusional”, “panic sell”, “crash”, “bottom” etc and then look for older posts.   It does take some effort to find good ones, but there are many. 

Until the price rockets to its next ath, I think it’s a good defense against the bs of our current crop of crash trolls who are trying to diminish morale here. 
So, I ask you an honest question and you downvoted me? Or did someone else do that? 
You sound like a teddy-bear.
I've edited, autocorrections are sometimes though. 

However, my bad language in that case, do not take off the fact that gaming industry is broken (suctioning our value).

And whether you like it or not I am here to use the decentralised power of Bitcoin to fight against it. That's what I have been working hard during the last 4 months ⚡
What advantages would a blockchain powered stock/bond market give us?
Do you think the big companies's leaders, the stock holder, and the most influent people will let us do that plan ? I wish so, a peaceful and smart upgrade of our system. But the problem is that nowadays, their money grants them proportional decision power, and they are actualy owning people's money and deciding how much it is worth. 

It looks to me like a pretty locked situation where we've to be super smart if we dont want thing to escalate.
Well their's 2 main argument for people only attract by lucrativ goals :   
\- if ppl get why we need blockchains and how blockchain works (+ the need of a decentralised etalon value, sucha as BTC, LTC or whatever), they'll want it, and we'll ALL moon. (most efficient way to create even more value)  
\- If they dont get why decentralisation is needed, we might see awfull centralised situation in the next few years. Blockchain are still threaten 
well, the crypto penetration rate is at a whopping 0.1%. got a long way to go the be a majority.
lol :)

I really wish you guys will stop propagating these nonsense like crypto replacing fiat.
It's not financial relation in my opinion, it's based on the fact that people are loosing faith and trust on the financial, economical and monetary system. Most dollar value is owned by big fisces, but it only has value because billions of humans think it has value. That's the limit of a trust based model
Its strength in numbers 
Who doesn’t is asking for trouble 
Someone said that an exchange had 7k as the BTC price, I was just going off of that
Looks like too high (based on other comments)
It's not really unregulated. It's just that, for now, regulators aren't paying close attention for whatever reason. 
Look at other comments people posted
Thank you very much. May you have a nice day.
[removed]
Nah, buy scratch offs instead. You have a chance to make money that way. 
Thanks for the response but that doesn't really answer my question though. Thanks anyways
DO WHAT EVER YOU WANT WITH YOUR OWN BITCOIN!!!!
lol @ your name
> I have a theory that a lot of early Bitcoin investors will kill themselves when they're rich old fucks who wasted their youth looking at charts.

Would this be good for Bitcoin or...?
No lambo.  House boat 
just give it a few more :p
Thanks for explaining that. 
Not me.  I only downvote shorters and Bcash types.
instant settlement primarily.

additional benefits to the economy being lowered compliance costs. the underlying assets and finances would also be on the a transparent distributed ledger, so various fund movements wouldn't need to be reported just to make the market a semblance more fair.
And also a lot of potential price appreciation. 🙂
Thank you for the information.
Thanks but I'm more interested in the aspect of how to start investing.
MAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYBEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!
Depends on where their private keys backups are..
Lear Jet :) 
Current technology isn't the limiting factor in settlement times, though:

>Modern technology lets investors make trades in a matter of milliseconds. But since 1993, the SEC’s rules have required brokers to wait for three business days between the time an investor’s order is executed, to when the cash and ownership of the security are exchanged.

https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-sec-settlement-idUSKBN16T1SW

The SEC just moved from T+3 to T+2. Even with blockchain (assuming it could handle the number of transaction that are needed) we would still be at T+2 until the SEC changed the rules.

What's the theoretical maximum transaction limit of Bitcoin? Like 11 transactions a second? How do you think a system like that is going to cope with ALL trades handled in a single stock exchange. I'm willing to bet just one or two high frequency traders ALONE would completely saturate the system.
Bitcoin isn't something that you invest in... It's a gamble, which is fine, but it's a gamble.
So these guys got fined by the SEC, but this gives you an idea how how much volume we're dealing with. This is from just one high frequency trader: Citadel 'sent multiple, periodic bursts of order messages, at 10,000 orders per second, to the exchanges. This excessive messaging activity, which involved hundreds of thousands of orders for more than 19 million shares, occurred two to three times per day."
yes the SEC and SROs typically do things in line with what large market participants can handle.

have you been following any scaling solution? distributed ledger technology is on a decent path to be competitive with other systems
How much?
[removed]
Most of the people here have zero clue about the real world beyond what they picked up from bitcoin "gurus" on youtube.
So what's the advantage again? That after scaling solutions are implemented, it might be competitive with similar, existing systems?
How much what?
Risk isn't necessarily correlated with higher returns. 
Thanks for the info.
> That after scaling solutions are implemented, it might be competitive with similar, existing systems?

while offering transparency benefits which result in lower costs of doing business, lower budget requirements for a regulatory agency, increased confidence in the securities markets

..... and instant settlement as we already discussed. whether the regulators give the "blessing" of T+1 in 2045 or not.
>instant settlement primarily.

Are we just guessing? I don't know enough about the inner workings of a stock exchange to refute this, but that also means that I know I'm not qualified to offer solutions to problems that I don't fully understand. If these advantages truly exist then stock exchanges would be crazy not to adopt this ASAP. 10 years later this hasn't happened. 
there is no legal certainty that they can adopt this.

this area of things is also changing.

all while the current state of the technology is not equipped to handle it just yet.
\> ..... and instant settlement as we already discussed. whether the regulators give the "blessing" of T+1 in 2045 or not.

Are you suggesting we have unregulated exchanges for stocks and securities running on blockchain?
we do already. for years. yes. welcome to the party.

the SEC even gave a no-action letter to one recently, which is great as 2013's SEC shut down 3 of such exchanges at once. fucked up crypto-securities for a few years until they rematerialized in their current form.

the decentralized ones already settle securities on-chain, with nobody to sanction.

so the SEC is already open to working on the regulatory framework since enforcement actions just make the industry route around them.
Can you give me a few examples of these exchanges?
I can but I feel like your healthy skepticism is done in a counterproductive way

for example, I think that once you learn about an exchange or two, you will create an argument about the merit of the service because it was nothing like a NYSE or online broker-dealer, instead of its place in history

I think you'll create an argument about the source of the information, instead of the accepted ramifications of the information

I could be wrong, but I think the main point is that people are still here because they see what the technology can do, and are open to helping it get there without being deterred by what isn't great right now, or in the past.

So these unregulated exchanges exist, but you're not able to tell me where I can find one? Are you talking about dark pools?
