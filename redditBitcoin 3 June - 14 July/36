Daily Discussion, June 09, 2018 -- TITLE
has it dawned on many of you that the strategies we are seeing are designed to make people give up? sells offs shake out one group of people. now we have a low volatility environment that will shake out the traders

meanwhile you can mine or buy and accumulate without trouble.

seriously. exchanges are investing untold millions in expanding. network hashpower is WAY up probably due to next gen asics being used in secret.

the price run is an exit strategy and happens when the larger players have had time to build up a nice stack buying the dead markets and mining. a good uptrend is established and another year long run begins to draw in the masses which provide the money flowing in to further support the price run and then you sell into that strength. it may be a year or two or three. don't stress over it. accumulate and wait.

this market just destroys ADHD mindsets

before 2021 you're going to hear about SEC regulations and they will most likely be favorable in the long term. more money will flow in. a bitcoin etf could bring countless billions. if the LN is perfected by then you have the scenario for 100k or more and even at 100k it would be the SMALLEST percentage gain between peaks we have ever seen. 2013 was 1k and 2017 was 20 fold, even 10 fold from 2017 would be 200k a coin. add in the halving and you have a very long term bull case for those who can be patient and just not stress over it...this probably eliminates 90\+&#37; of people just like it did 2009\-2017
Morning chaps!

LN rolling out.

I haven't shot my dog yet.

All looking **good for bitcoin** :)
Weak dip.  Boring... if you gonna crash make it fun.
None of this makes sense. None of it...  the more powerful and technologically advanced this gets it drops in value.  Can I buy a vowel?
BTFD and DCA. The future is already written.
Weak hands are gone. What’s left are a few day traders and stubborn hodl mofos.  This market manipulation is bullshit and futile.  See you
at 8k next weekend. 
This feels weird. This might be the calm before the storm.
[deleted]
Well, its time to 8k. 
What the hell is going on!?
bitcoin is dipping hard
Whoever is dumping on the market right now: 

🖕

not selling bitch!
Shorters everywhere in this thread!! It'll be up to 7700 in a day or 2 max
BTC \^\^
morning my friends
The volume should continue to drop while price range continues to narrow. May go on for a few days.
Do you think volume is low because miners are not selling their coins because the market price is too low at the moment?
here we go
Ok wtf going on now
The opposite way
So, Bitcoin is not dead?
[Bye HODLERS](https://imgur.com/a/u2Q04cB)
Buy,Buy,Buy,Buy
Here we go we’re mooning 
Personally I'm not bothered.

Just a good way to shut down all those worthless shitcoins.
20 trillion market cap, 
BTC will be 25000
no wait 40000
There’s not enough BTC for every millionaire to own one. 
Crypto doesn’t correlate with equity
Big money is going to start pouring in. 


U get the point. All bullshit propaganda. We’re going to 5000 and below.....
In the short term, I don´t think that we are going to test 7000\-6800, maybe this weekend a soft down to 7300\-7200, but not too much. In the medium term I strong believed we are going to hit 10.000$ in the next three months. In the long term, moon or 6.000$ both possible. 

I just sold a 33&#37; around 7651 (bitstamp) and I expect to buy back around 7450 if I can stay strong and the market do his part. 
Olah!

I'm new to bitcoin and to this subreddit but I'm loving it. 

However: Is this a pro bitcoin echo chamber?

I'm interested to hear some of your honest worries, concerns, doubts and anything else on the negative side.
This is the lowest volume I have seen on GDAX. Last time it was this low (around 3k) was a month ago when bitcoin started dipping from 9.8k range. 
Does this low volume again mean a dip is coming? I think it does. Any ideas over this?
We on the moon yet?
Morning, Come on dip down to six or seven thou one last time i just got paid! i wanna get 100$
https://youtu.be/b0LHOXgzymE

I don’t know if this is allowd here,

But from the netherlands, just HOLD 
Feels like we will be testing price lows with the volume and market sentiment this past week. I wonder what it will take to get us out of this slump. Anyone think World Cup online betting will give us a boost?
It's getting too easy, brace yourself.

Some more news out of South Korea about ICOs...

Seems the more good news we have the more people dump. Are crypto people this dumb? allergic to profit? wtf is going on..gov after gov are giving positive news about adoption yet you people are dumping...WTFFFFFFFFF???????????????????????????????????????????????
interesting live stream on BTC here pretty informative. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsEZmjRKWNo

Any suggestions on fundraising some 10k USD for licenses 
I heard someone is about to dump 9700 BTC into the market is it true? 
My hands aren’t weak.  But see ya 
Party it up, thought I’d never see these prices again. 
This is how I feel about this market lately. 
https://giphy.com/gifs/vintage-humor-xTkcECavNADSBtW36w
Any whale's bitcoin address that might be causing the dump? Couldn't find any whale selling off from the top 200 bitcoin holders' addresses. Weird.
Woooo weeee look at that huge juicy bloody turd dropping... see u all at 5k
Ok guy's say the market is being manipulated by whale. Let me ask you a question, when the price of btc drop do they lose money? Yes. So why would they want the price to drop? So they can attain more btc. So when the price drops whales lose money just like the rest of us, but the buy up the coin everyone else is selling. So if you wanna be a whale you have to think like a whale. Buy,Buy,Buy.
We are fooked. Wall Street wants the price lower. And they won’t stop until they get their wish. HODL.
we're mooning! almost 7500 again! :D
Short. Every. Rally. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Get your 5k memes ready.
trading volume it's scary low. For how long the artificial uptrend can continue? 
I have set my buy orders at 5k$.

Bitcoin to $100,000 and WHY!
https://youtu.be/uASjO9ofEL4
Hello readers, my name is Max. I have a request for you. Yes YOU the reader! I am looking to purchase Bitcoin at a discounted rate because I do not see it holding this value for much longer. If you would like to get out safely, just sell it to me! I will gladly buy it from you for just 3% below market rate. You can't find a better deal! Find me on the top 5 major exchanges, just look for my buy orders!
I like your optimism. Keep talking. You’re making me feel like an early adopter. 

$200K Bitcoin sounds like a fantasy but then again so did $20K bitcoin in 2014 back when it fell to $200. Buy $200K would require a $3.2 trillion market cap when the whole world wealth is $200 trillion. Sounds far fetched though I could see the possibility in 2030.
I came for investment but I stayed for the technology. It works for me so I'll just wait for the rest of the world to catch up.
"Acculait" Accumulate and wait.
i always wanted a dog.  is he house trained?
Nice volume on the drop, not that boring if you understand what your are seeing.
I know, ooooh wow!!  $7200. Boring!!  Let's see$4500 or something
Excitement builds.
The most powerful and innovative technology in the world... Home Depot is worth more than entire BTC market cap.
.
Yes.  Cost of technology always decrease.

Internet, mobile phones, cars, TVs, .... I can't think of any counter example.
The price is up over a thousand percent in the last 2 years even though the technology hasn't gotten any better, fees are much higher, transaction times are worse, fewer merchants accept it, and there is far more competition. If the price movements were rational, bitcoin would have never gone above $1k.
what if we dip below 6k?
[deleted]
12k* never underestimate bitcoin
Well, looks like you called it.

I told you someone always calls it good prediction.

What has bitcoin got to do with your bank account?
fiat on the highs, buy buy buy on the lows
Bloodshed.
I think I'm gonna try to catch a knife. Going with my gut here
Just flip the chart.
i dont think someone who can influence the market that way cares what me or you think xD
I'm sorry, it was me. I decided to dumb about $20 billion today in the crypto market. Total accident. I won't do it again except maybe tomorrow, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, etc...

bonjour
2,508 BTC 24\-hour volume on GDAX. Sheeesh. That must be a record low.
Bitcoin Diamond (as close to a shitcoin as you can get) is up over 3% - this market is a complete joke.

So hodl your proper coins.  You will win out in the end.
It's the calm before the storm.
that and with no easy to read price movements traders aren't trading
around $10m worth of coins got sold to buy orders. 
Honestly it's not even a lot of money on the scales we're dealing with.
Can't  a guy just sell some coins ?
All you have to do is look at the bitcoin charts for the last 8 years to see bitcoin has more lives than a cat. 
No it’s not dead.... just sleepy
why why why
Sell sell sell sell
Lmao so much for mooning
Finally👍
I was so stupid to believe in that propaganda, now I’m losing my money. Fuck crypto. I’m cashing out and never coming back again. And you are so deluded that you will buy every dip and gamble everything you have for ones and zeros on your computer. 
why are you here if all you're going to do is cry? you don't know shit about having your portfolio bleed to death if you haven't witnessed and been impacted by the 1200 > 180$ drop between late 2013 and 2015, gtfo
All of these propaganda were started by the whales after they have accumulated enough cheap coins before they engineered the Dec ATH.

What we are seeing since then is a systematic 'pump & dump' for them to dispose of these coins.
so you did that so that "maybe" you grab 2% ? :) It has to be a lot of money to be worth the effort...
No, this is a pro echo bitcoin chamber. 
I feel pretty negative about my dog.  I keep meaning to shoot it, but haven't got round to it yet.

Regarding crypto: well BTC is a good long-term investment, but it is a bit up and down.  But so is the whole market.

Regarding doubts: I suspect some female tennis players have a Y chromosome, but I'm not sure.
no, it is a pro dogecoin echo chamber.
Occasionally I do worry about the mental health of nocoiners that regularly bash Bitcoin even though their same old arguments has been proven wrong for many years.
people don't care about it  anymore, the big hype is over
Lowest volume in the last 30 days https://data.bitcoinity.org/markets/volume/30d?c=e&t=b 
Nothing wrong with buying $100 in Bitcoin. I've  even  bought $40 worth.

Personally I see Bitcoin as type of savings account.... To store some value (and other uses) why not add $100 here and there?

Everyone I know who owns Bitcoin and has stuck with it started small, its great way to get comfortable using a wallet and playing around with transactions without worrying about some  mistake that  we make more often when we're new. (although everything is so much user friendly than just 1 year ago, it's still a good idea)

Then keep dollar cost averaging... BTC has been stable for the last 4 months... Accumulate all summer if you can
$100 doesn't make much of a difference through for 7000 or 8000...that's like a $10 +/- diff worth of bitcoin? lol i think long-term is key and whether it breaks through 10k or 6k
Please dont buy bitcoin if u cant afford to buy a decent amount. Ur wasting ur money.
No, holding is not really an acceptable thing to do in these circles. Hodl'ing, on the other hand, is an accepted and some say, smart thing to do. ;)
you mean lull.  Unless your nurse is singing to you.
:) you people? bought too high?
Only manipulation. They play the game sell and buy again cheaper.
We thank you for your time. Do come back in 2020 in time for the next halving.
gofundme? 
no clue, i saved up an extra $4200 thanks to crypto. look for good projects and get in early ftw?
500000 BTC was traded in the last 24 hours so this would be nothing unusual 
Did you hear it on the Grape Vine?
Ur name says it all
Nah it's 9690 we good.
that's all? you realize we mint 1800/day just in mining right now?
Hoping it stays low for awhile so I can accumulate. 
5k-6k would be good for the future of bitcoin.  Short term we would lose, but long term more investors = new fiat.
When they drop the price the don't lose money, they have big leveraged shorts, that's what they go around stop hunting noobs. 
When you dispose of large quantities of BTC, of course the price will drop.

Therefore, the obvious way is to 'pump and dump'.  Which is what has been happening for a long time.

I doubt if most of them are buying back.  They accumulated long before ATH (which was the big pump).  Now, they are just disposing.  That's also why you see the price dropping since ATH.
We are just trying support for third time. Nothing scary
Smart people should be buying right now. 
You got conned.

All the buying was completed before the Dec ATH was engineered.  And all that has been happening since then is systematic dumping.
The only way to make money with Bitcoin
Yea seriously -whats the deal. Any factors given for this drop?
It's a big concern.

Economically speaking, this can be the aftermath of a lot of manipulative trading that has run its course.

I suspect that following that manipulation, the current price is artificially low.

I expect a surge in buying soon.
It's the calm before the storm
Artificial, they said...
So, you don't want to buy.
Ive set my sell order at 100k. Hashtaguselessinfo
Shilling for the whales so that they can find more willing buyers as they dump?
ME?
Today I heard the Dotcom market was $6 trillion in 1999. In that context a Bitcoin MC of $3T doesn't seem implausible. 
Yes.  He's rather quiet and calm normally, but is surprisingly good at dodging a bullet when the situation demands.
>t through A

You fools have no influence on whales. Things always come on their terms.. they will make it $4500 if they feel like it. Yes, it's mostly emotion\-driven for whales... they're not some scientific statistician geniuses as many would allude to... they are just dumb assholes with a lot of money.
I’m sory, bitcoin is most powerful and innovative technology in the world? How deluded can you be my friend? We have robots, computers, cars, smartphones, plains, spaceships, but sending ones and zeros from computer to computer is suddenly most powerful thing in the world? Bullshit.
Read the comment.  Then vomit your responses 
This guy can’t read

There are probably a few still around but most should be gone by now after 5 months of torture.

Watch out butter-fingers! Its hot!
It may actually get worse. A very unique and remarkable situation. This is very good for Bitcoin.
Not til it's time for me to sell lol
Dont ask why just Buy.
Why would you sell lol. O your the buy high sell low guy got it.
What does it mean?
Ones and zeros on a Blockchain
not too much indeed (2500$) and finally I only executed a 50% of the order... So the rest was cash and I bought at 6950. I am a day trader, 2% is really good profit for a day trader, don’t mind the amount, just make as much operations as can. I am on this just for fun, not to make REAL MONEY... For that I have a decent job. 
insightful
Woof (woof, woof, woof,
it's kinda hard to be a nocoiner really. even if you have 1 penny worth of bitcoin you're a holder...it's not hard to get a penny either
[Bitfinex just had its daily lowest volume in a 1-year window.](https://www.tradingview.com/x/03SrN2Ps/)
What arsey advice.
Lols I'm dollar cost averaging just 100 bucks every 2 weeks. I'm in it long not trying to sell.
[deleted]
I strongly believe that the whole market is waiting for me to sell so it can take off. I am the chosen one! Millions of investors the market has chosen me to screw with. 
Looking for something more like Technology grants
You are right.  Except that I won't call them long term investors.  More appropriate term is - Bag Holders.

If it's still not clear that whales and exchanges orchestrated the Dec ATH as the pivot to accumulate and dump BTC for cash, then please keep holding.
But you make no sense if they pumped the price all the way to $20,000 why would they sell at $7,500. The time to buy is when the whales buy (which is now) and the time to sell is when the whales sell. Its not hard. Don't be fooled. A "Whale" is the same as bank they are in the business of making money.  
I’m sick of hearing this.
whales are getting exhausted supporting the current price and there are not many newcomers to the market, hence it's an artificial growth. 
Heh.  
We have robots, computers, cars, smartphones, plains, spaceships, but sending money with my bank to another country takes 3-5 days and can be done only during working hours...
This guy can’t read either 
Yeah we buy until your bags are no longer that heavy got it 👌
Christ, you're good fun.
No glutens in whine.
find a side job. not the best time to be selling. prices are low
I see, if you can afford it, i would not sell at this price.

Do you still have access to your bank account? Sorry, I’m not a native English speaker and not a 100% sure if depleted means that your access was blocked.


If you still have access and need the fiat right now, transfer your bitcoin to an exchange and redeposit fiat to your account. You will pay fees but it’s the ‚safest‘ way.

If you don’t have access to your bank account I’m not quite sure. Maybe try one of those bitcoin machines. I haven’t seen one personally so I am not sure how they work
Why would I sell at 7k when I can sell at 4k later, good point.
Double rainbow
no u
no u
Heh.
I ain’t going to lie I do feel like a bag holder.   Sometimes I have gut feeling to sell and be safe with my hard earned money, than the market teases you by making a little period of recovery only for it to be taken all away in one dip.  I’m so deep into this investment, Sadly, I would actually feel better to lose everything  rather than walking away now because I still believe in the future of Bitcoin. 
indeed, the whales (read bulls and bears) can only be killed by holding your bag for a few years, and not acting.
If you do not yet realize that the bears and bulls are the same (whales, trading platforms) then you do not understand and you better stop.
if whales keep the price low, the little man gets in. That little man does not step in at 20k.
That way they shake everyone empty.
They bought it at pre 2017 prices for less than $1k.

Of course they sold plenty at $20k and resulted in the price dropping.  So what they are doing now is to regularly pump up the price (to $15k, $14k ... $7.5k) and then resume selling (dump) which result in price fall.

Dude, whales don't give a shit about BTC.  To them, it's just an instrument for what will soon be unveiled as the biggest scam in history.
Yawn, they didn't pump the price to 20k that was just one of the regular bitcoin bubbles fueled by new mostly naive investors and crazy media attention. Whales are not buying here and the time to sell its when you think the market is in bear more and we have more room to drop, which we have. Precisely because a whale is in the business of making money is why they are shorting and stop hunting naive traders and pushing the market down.
Yet you are here....   take a break for the summer and come back in the fall. Things are going to be a lot better by then.  Or sooner 
Bull whales are getting exhausted, they said ...
You obviously have little experience making cross country money transfers.

No, it doesn't take 3-5 days and most banks offer it as a online service.

International wire transfers are almost instantaneous. It's certainly much faster than bitcoin transactions.
On second thoughts, eat a loaf of bread.
[deleted]
Bet U bought in a 7600+, and there is no way you bought any cheaper and now you decide enough is enough lol. Selling for a lose is just that, so if you are in it for investment point then you are not doing good if you are selling on a dip.
What does it mean?
No you both
There might still be another parabolic rise down the line.

So if you are prepared to hodl till then regardless of how low the current price goes, then it's a viable option.

The only way they can shake you empty is if you sell.When You sell You lose your Btc and money.
So a whale rather sell at $7500 than $20000 how does that make sense. whales buy and sell. They buy low sell high. The average joe buys high and sells low thats how they make money. So from 20k to 7K i'd say were low and I am going to buy until it hit Zero. Note to self as long as whales own btc you are in good hands. 
So whales to pump up the price they just make it go down.
No, it will not. I bought in February hoping it would be better in summer. But it’s worse. And it will continue to dump whole year. Cash out and invest in real things.
check the price and see if they were right
Most, not mine... Mine takes 2 days to make a SEPA transfert... So non SEPA would only be worse
hustle. i'd rather sell extras on ebay, work at a store if you have to vs sell off bitcoin at the lowes. well...unless you have a lot. if you have 10\+ coins you could sell 1 for living money until you are able to secure something
Except if that dip is just the tip of the iceberg and selling now means further cutting your loses and good risk management instead of going down with the boat for some kind of herd mentality.
All the way
One more thing never buy the pump always I repeat always buy the dumps.
So your the weak hands they are trying shake out. Hodl strong buddy this is the wrong time to throw in the towel.
I feel ya.   When I start to think like that I read this:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/22qc1d/as_someone_who_has_invested_140k_into_bitcoin_i/

Selling bitcoin is a very dangerous game.  Good luck. 
Ahh, young grasshopper. I shall teach you the whale way.
[deleted]
But thats the thing you may say let me cut my loses and sell then a few minutes or days later it goes up a $1000 and you say I think btc has recovered and you buy back in then btc goes down $200. There is never a right time to sell.
Up?
The Physicist perhaps a bit more empathy would work here. 

Some people are down thousands in Kin.
my way or the highway :)
You could always upload one to gdax. Sell it in fractions as you need money. You can do a free direct bank transfer with them and they support Google Authenticator which really increases the safety. 
You wish.
I’m very empathetic. I’m way down too but i know enough about bitcoin that with patience it will come back stronger.  Selling the bottom would be foolish. Trying to save a few people from making that mistake. 
With the  flash crash over last two hours we are not recovering for months-year(s). 
Years?  Comon.  Months maybe 
That’s the sickening part XD
