Daily Discussion, June 04, 2018 -- TITLE
I'm learning to buy whenever all the comments in this thread are negative. That $5k day earlier this year was right on.

For me it's bullish AF.
why did this one get locked?

Is this just a coincidence because the volume is dying down or does that really look like someone's deliberately working to create a certain pattern on the charts?

2018 has been the evil stepmother of Bitcoin and all of cryptocurrency.
The truth is btc was, and still is, making lower and lower highs.  The big view doesn't lie. Someday that descending value will finally turn around.  Patience.  (edit: we're talking about since the last run up)
**The Internet of Money: Five Years Later**

In this talk, Andreas reflects on all the exhilarating and terrifying moments of the last five years in Bitcoin, especially the price bubble of 2017. But he also reminds people who have come for the price that they should stay for the principles.

This keynote talk happened during the epic one-night only extravaganza at the historic Music Box Theater in Chicago on April 25th, 2018.

The main event, emceed by Pamela Morgan, was a live recording of the 5-year anniversary episode of the Let’s Talk Bitcoin Podcast. All four hosts Adam B. Levine, Stephanie Murphy, Jonathan Mohan, and Andreas M. Antonopoulos were together on-stage for the first time ever. The hour-long episode included the hosts discussing some of their favorite memories over the past five years, what’s happening now, and of course, they encouraged some audience participation. The show was recorded and made available as a podcast on the LTB network.

15k this month.
"Buy Bitcoin," they said. "It's exciting," they said.
It really bums me out to see people getting emotional about the short term price; still looking at bitcoin as a fiat investment instead of what it truly is. 
down, it was to be expected again
My prediction is it will be $10k within the next 33,607 seconds. 
no one buys or sells now and waits for the 6th, and then the big crash/moonshot?
Why does it go down right after I buy? Every. Time.
I just got my full node running. Using command line only (no gui). It is responding to my rest requests via postman such as "getblockchaininfo" as well as direct bitcoin-cli calls from the command line. What are some cool things I can do now?
Am I the only one really hating GDAX down for maintenance? This would be acceptable if the cryptocurrency wasn’t a 24 hour market like the stock market. I know it hasn’t had too much of an impact - Coinbase inconveniently doing maintenance during peak evening hours usually from 8-9 PM (PST) but how is this possible? I’m not familiar with other exchanges like OKEX, Bitfinnex or Bitrex...whether or not they have these periodic freezes to do maintenance but it sounds very illegitimate and unethical. Just because trading on GDAX is paused doesn’t mean the whole cryptocurrency market pauses as well. That’s what disturbs me. A lot of activity can happen in an hour or so. If my discontent for Coinbase/GDAX wasn’t already at its all time high, these maintenance calls really takes the cake. It has already lost me money because prices immediately dive once GDAX is restored. I know GDAX at least gives you advanced courtesy notice but that still is not acceptable. If Facebook, Twitter and Google can all manage without shutting down their websites for an hour (and they don’t affect you financially), then why can’t GDAX manage. Really hating these people!

You never bring me Lambos anymore when I buy dips and HODL you...
And there's no excitement left like before in the memes we do...
You're trying hard not to show it
But Bitcoin, Bitcoin I know it

You lost that FOMO feelin'
Whoa, that FOMO feelin'
You lost that FOMO feelin'
Now it's gone, gone, gone, woh


Bitcoin, Bitcoin, I'd get down on my knees for you
If you would only MOON for me like you used to do, yeah
We had a dream, a dream, a dream you don't find everyday
So don't, don't, don't, don't let it slip away


Bring back that FOMO feelin'
Whoa, that FOMO feelin'
Bring back that FOMO feeling'
'Cause it's gone, gone, gone
And I can't go on, woh


🎵 🎵 🎵
Can we get to $8k within the next few days?
If you care about the price that much, you've invested money you shouldn't have, or don't get it. If BTC meets it's end goal, you won't care about the fiat value. Your fiat will be worthless. That's the dark side.. of the Moon.

The pining and worry is great entertainment, though.
Where can I learn about bitcoin that is easily understood?  All the technical stuff confuses me easily :(
**June 13**
The US Securities and Exchange Commission are holding the SEC investor Conference in Atlanta, where attendants will meet with members for a more informal discussion on issues regarding regulation in the crypto-currency field, mutual funds and fraud prevention.

Official SEC website advertises the event as follows:

*Meet the people who help make Wall Street work for Main Street. All five SEC Commissioners are coming to Atlanta to meet with you: young people, the military, urban and rural, those saving for retirement, and seniors—the diverse, the dynamic people of the southeast region.*

Some members of the community have been recently concerned that SEC might classify crypto-currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum as securities. 
The security classification would have a devastating effect on the market due to tax regulation and legal ownership of crypto assets.

However, SEC Officials calmed the spirits by saying it was ICO Tokens they are looking at, not Bitcoin. 
The main topic of discussions will be around the processes involved in ICO investments and how to classify them.

What does the magic eight ball say will happen today?
Volume is a lot lower now due to more people hodling, do you agree?
Tired of this bear market! How it is gonna last, fuck
Anyone not believe in this shit anymore and are just bagholding with the hopes that their alt coins will be untethered from this bitmex/bitfinex ponzi scheme eventually?
I guess we'll continue our journey to the center of the earth after we've came back from our quick visit from the moon.
Certainly is exciting!  Long or short, there's always a trading range!  So trade or HODL your butt...
Best part: goes up for one week, crashes everything that was gained in 2 hours.
I guess the whales have made enough money to not give a fuck about killing the crypto market. If I was still sitting on the sidelines I don't think I'd buy in after recent events.
Bloody red turd droppening. Same ol shit.  It was a ruse by whales to get people to fomo, then they cash out on yalls ass.
Are we bottoming or what? Or just a wack a mole action?
Time to drain the swamp boys and girls.
Should I buy now please? 
After we made 3 Bart formations this week, the most bullish chart in history of Bitcoin, all of a sudden a huge drop...
Bitcoin is not Gold, but its worth noting that when Gold hit $800 in 1981 it took nearly 30 years to hit that number again.  Two Generations had to go by before the price set a new high, which, dollar adjusted, was still well below $800.
what a joke.
 Bitcoin Core v0.16.1rc1 has been tagged last week! Update soon!
**Come On Bulls, show us that you mean business!**
[removed]
Well, i think people have quite enough 6 months dumps. Bitcoin has not progress since january.The best time to invest was in 2016-17, right now too much people know about bitcoin, and they expect they gonna be rich, but its not working like that, it would be so easy. 
Whales don't want rise btc price cause in just 1 day can be dump.
If we can break 10k last month, it would be look better, but right now.. most of holders  just doubt about btc.
I just saw that the NASDAQ will open crypto exchange but will not be available to U.S. residents? Isn't that in New York?
 Why does it go down right after I buy? 
What do people feel about [https://www.arbitraging.co/](https://www.arbitraging.co/), it lookes promising, reminds me of bitconnect, but with actual proof and no lock\-in\-period for investment
We we are down about $100 from a few hours ago. What do you think America will do when they wake up? Will they panic and sell or buy. I think because we have had an up weekend it might correct a bit, but I'm hoping that's not the case since we are down deeper than I think we should be.
Guys if you haven’t seen this, you must click. This is a game changer.

https://thebitcoincore.org
I just wanted to point out something so that when it happens nobody panics. The tops and bottoms have been happening on the 6th of the month since the spike in December. If we hit a lower low on June 6th, say 6000 or lower, it's actually incredibly bullish. We can only go up from there. So keep this in mind and get your buy orders ready.
This ontop of china easing down on crypto regulations, heading it towards legal, is gold

BULL BULL BULL
you be liberated... 369
manipulators (trading platforms such as gdax, litebit, kraken, bitstamp, etc.) keep the price low so that the small man can step in and be burned. thats the scam....
There will be no moon
The lows are getting higher tho
McAfee said so!

No, but seriously, i hope the guy is right. It's not THAT high actually if you compare it with the ATH of december and take in account that 6 months have gone by.

And hell, if the predictions of 50K by the end of the year are more or less right, it should hit 15K this month already!
"Wait till June 6th" they said
It is because the crowd here is so young. A month truly feels like an eternity for them (and it should).
Friday slight preweekend pump, Monday post weekend dump.
9h?
What is happening on the 6th?
that's what you call, getting fomo'd. now sell your loss to complete the transaction. isn't that how this works?
[deleted]
Transfer your Bitcoin to a local wallet and retransfer them to a remote one. This will guide your IP for the second transaction and makes you more free.
The good thing of a full node is that you are the first node to broadcast the transaction and your IP will remain inside your node
the same with litebit....coincidence???


GDAX only just recently started making money comparable to Google and Facebook and I imagine the kind of updates that would let them do the rolling updates would first need these kind of updates where they have to shut things down. Bear in mind only 6 months ago they couldn't keep up with all the new registrations and accounts joining the app. They learned a lot of their weaknesses this past year and I imagine they are still rolling out Solutions to problems they didn't know they had
Sounds like Maverick https://youtu.be/PLzVbz2HHzo
Killin it 👍🏼
👆🏼Going through 3rd divorce due to no sense of humor👆🏼
No.  (I’m gonna be super negative this week so that it will do the opposite of what it usually does). 
Wonderfully written.

bitzuma.com have some really good articles explaining how various aspects of bitcoin work. 
[The Internet Of Money](https://theinternetofmoney.info/) by Andreas Antonopolous
crypto is a mess. you can start there. Good luck.
IDK, it doesn't work until the 6th of each month ( ͡~ ͜ʖ ͡°)
http://www.shaarr.com/themes/img/preview/8-ball.jpg 😣 dam you magic 8 ball
I think you're right, and it's probably going to continue like that until there's almost nobody selling. Then will come the BGDs.
No, it's low because public interest is waning.  

What do you expect when the only news that people hear are "bitcoin has lost xxx%"?
Volume is lower because the price sux. It should be $15k then volume would booming. Dumbass 12 year olds.
Nobody knows.  DCA small amounts and think you spent it on crack.  At the worst, you'll make better returns than your other investments long term.  That is how Bitcoin works.
Dunno.  Your bigger concern is not the bear market.

You should be more concerned about people starting to believe that digital tokens with no real world use case aren't worth thousands of dollars.
Yes! I don't own a dime of bitcoin and only come here to check sentiment of this shitty waste of a coin that drags my useful altcoin down to hell regularly.
I just want to buy 1080 ti FE below $500 ;) that's my politics right there...
Got in December still up a lot thanks to masternodes
7700$ moon? Thats not even 40% of ATH. What will you call the pump from 2k to 3k?
we never been there and we never will..... #The Shining
Trading anything other than crypto would have been more exciting
yep, they literraly killed alot of interest in this market
I should clarify that it's too bad they're giving crypto a bad stigma because I believe there's still a lot of opportunity in the long run for average Joe's to better their financial position in this market.
Cryptos won't die ... they will just fade away like good soldiers

Nah. You see things that don't exist.
Why?  It's been climbing steadily and holding 7.5k.

I don't know what you are expecting but this is good.
Short. Every. Rally.
It's in the process of setting up a triple bottom. I still think we have some room to go down. My prediction is that we hit 6500 or so in a few days then up from there to try and get past 10k again.
Right now I'm not touching this with a 10 ft. pole. 

Buy when you can.
yes! buy buy buy, sell the house and buy all in!
What did you learn? :)
What’s bitcoIn core? I only know Bitcoin
Are you from 2020?
Theres so much wrong with this post and the fact you think bitcoin hasnt progressed means you're just as the people you're talking about..
It's a fragile balance between risking to loose control of the market and kill all profit coming from the market. If they can milk this cow forever, they will do it.
Bought almost whole coin in the low and high 8k’s. Went down immediately. 
Trying selling ... it might help the rest of us.
He bogt - domp it....get Vitalyk on ze line...
If it does I think 7500 will hold
LOL, the market now either has no volume, or big dump.
Another fork? 
This means you know who is pretending Bitcoin is Bitcoin Core when it's actually another coin. 
your game sux, just like your life...
I think someone said the same at 9k, last month
> The tops and bottoms have been happening on the 6th of the month since the spike in December.

it's just not even true.  the price on 5th may was higher than that on 6th may.  the price on 5th march was higher than that on 6th march.  it's just people trying to impose their perceptions on noise.
Why not wait to buy at 5,4,3,2,1000?
I can believe this.  Reel people in on the "lows", but the highs get lower and lower.
Also heard 2pac and elvis are in this scam. Also, bush did 9/11
First words said about Trains, planes, cars, quantum mechanics, Internet, Google, Amazon, Apple. Bitcoin is just taking longer. It’s a harder switch to a different currency. 
C O N S O L I D A T I O N
McAfee is a drug addled zombie spewing the same anti-establishment rhetoric for years. He clearly is using his position in the public eye to pump BTC so he can buy more drugs or a larger prosthetic penis once he has severed and consumed his own. 
what if i say to you we stay below 12k for whole year
Chinese/Mongolian/Thai/Indian/Russian/Canadian/Mexican new year sell off they said.... ;)
I dunno, I put the blame more on people who are investing money which, in truth, they ought not to be risking. If it was money they were truly comfortable risking on an investment, they wouldn't be so emotional about the price.
How do you *know* that the crowd here is young?
Yeah why not. This prediction was brought to you from the Anus of Answers. 
some voodoo superstition about peaks/troughs happening on the 6th of every month.  but if you look at the data, sometimes they occur one, two, three days before or after the 6th...  just noise.
change of sentiments \-\> if its gone down, it will go up and visa\-versa! some predicting a bull run starting the 6th
Technically, yeah I guess.
Oh good idea. I'll do some transactions to get the hang of it.
😆
you should've learnt your lesson 1st time - funny guy ;0 #MGTOW
Good plan.  

I'm having my dog shampooed tomorrow.

Then I will buy it a big bone and take it for a walk.

Edit: in this version I don't shoot it.
Wonderfully commented upon.
wonderfully commented
What's with all the fudsters? This Is how I know its a great time to buy.
It is decidedly so
Or until people become so desperate and dump to reach huge lows so that the greedy BGDs can jump in so low. They don't have an issue to wait, they have a lot of spare money anyway, not like the small traders who need "real" money to feed their families! 
there will always be someone to sell...it all depends on their "entry" price...
Yes because buy high sell low is the way to go.
these 16 y.olds that think they are any smarter than 12 y.olds....
investing in crack will most likely be better investment than any token at this point.... best fucking hodl if you look at the price per gram for the last 10 years... Irony
*infinity dollars.
We call that Uranus.
just in 7 days you will be dreaming about this "price"... ;)
Why?  

I thought all of us are just in "for the tech".  Or that cryptos will replace fiat so the current price is irrelevant?
Buy. Every. Dip. 
I node what you mean...
It's never a bad time to buy Bitcoin.
TA is "bull"shit ;)
Learned that only allpowerfull Marge Simpson pattern can save Bitcoin at this point :)
The bears were wearing bull costumes.
they don't learn... ever
Dude bitcoin core is the client i am referring to.....it is the biggest client that is used...
2020 confirmed \^\^
Thank you for being dumb, please buy more....
Yup.
It's not going to ever go below 5k. If it does I'll eat my nutsack.
Currency?  

That's really funny because 99.9% of BTC transactions are people selling it to each other hoping to make a profit.
Drug addled zombies take offense to that. He's on a whole 'nother level
You're an optimist I see!
Pfff, fine by me, i will be able to buy a lot more! :D
There's always an asshole :/
You need to use the voodoo calendar, which is +/- 3 days every month.
I can't take that seriously at all to be honest. 
dude ???
Lol
Wonderfully wasting away our life 
wonderfully commented upon upon....
not everyone shares the same opinion. if you basing your financial decisions off of people's  comments on reddit, good luck.
I mean : not enough. Almost nobody. Less and less. You know what I mean !
always
Ur anus.... huh, sounds about right
How many BTC did you buy at the cheap cheap price of 7700?
[deleted]
Climb. Every. Mountain.

How's that "dip" buying going? lol
Just bougth 10 BTC and price went down.... boged :(
We should not judge a book by its cover :)
I can confirm rootbeerspin is from the future, he was at my funeral in 2030.
They're trying to put more confusion in noob minds with that name though
Any idea whats the difference between BTC and BTCC?
It could though. Stop being a 5 year old.
Investing in crypto is great, you get all of these win-wins.
A random claim without evidence. Thanks for the lulz
hey i dont want it to stay low, just being a realist in this bear market
yea same
if you allow +/- 31 days then the pattern is flawless.
On the 23rd of August the price of Bitcoin will go up.


Wow, that's really easy.
i'm not superstitious either, but if you look at the chart it's pretty much lining up to the 6th and around one or two days, the past few months.
we don't have one...
It's a Zimbabweyan NY sell off, I bought more at $666.666 ;)
We're on our way to a perfect tripple bottom so cashing in is probably the best idea now, financially, if you bought in at 7.000 or above.
Buying all the way down.. like every week, for two years. Except during the madness in January.

Market can't be predicted, so this is the safest and long-time proven strategy.

Hour charts are funny. Plan on holding to 2020.
Indeed, we had to learn it the hard way :(.
Your funeral is in 2033 January 13

RogerCoin / Bcash has already cynically introduced brand confusion.  

BTCC is an attempt to ameliorate this and make Ver's attempted misbranding of BTC logically unsupportable.
looks like another troll coin about to blow up.. I thought dogde was a unique case...ah
.. the argument of a 6 year old?
Can't accept reality?  

Show me any wide scale use case of BTC being use as a currency other than the occasional marketing gimmick.
Number one rule of Bitcoin. Nobody... and I don't care if you're Brian Armstrong or if you're John McAfee. Nobody knows if a bitcoin is gonna go up, down, sideways or in fucking circles. Least of all, r/bitcoin, right?
I could draw you any number of lines on that chart doing the same thing, that point to different days. Sure the price seems to be oscillating and homing in on $7800, but the timing isn't nearly as precise as that stupid diagram makes it out to be, there are plenty of peaks and troughs ignored which would give it a different gradient.
Not too late to sell. 
If you like 6600 then you're going to love 4600.
Thats kinda genius
