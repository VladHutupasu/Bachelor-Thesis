Daily Discussion, July 13, 2018 -- TITLE
Many people see the rising global debt as an indication of a coming economic collapse. I agree that current levels of debt are unsustainable ; however I don't believe the economic "meltdown" will proceed as many believe it will. Most people when they think of economic collapse associate it with the collapse of markets; real-estate, stock markets, etc.

But when debt truly reaches unsustainable levels economic collapse doesn't manifest as falling markets. It will manifest as skyrocketing markets.

We are already paying a significant fraction of the US budget to just pay the interest on our current debt. 7.4% of our total budget is spent just on the interest on the US debt. Each year this % rises and at a certain point we will be faced with cutting other programs in order to just pay the interest on this debt. This is known as austerity.

Austerity in Europe happens because no one country controls the currency. So when greece goes into debt; it can't just create more money to pay off that debt. It must cut programs or raise taxes to pay that debt.

In the US on the other hand; we control the worlds reserve currency. So as our debt increases; and our interest payments increase; we can print more money to pay off those interest payments.

But the USD is itself an instrument of Debt. So printing more money just increases the debt; increasing the interest payments ; increasing the need to print more money and go deeper in debt.

This pattern has repeated itself countless times throughout history.

The collapse will actually cause prices of everything to increase at increasing rates. Owners of assets and means of production will greatly benefit ; those on fixed salaries or income will lose.

People think that Bitcoin is a bubble; but don't even consider that Fiat may be in an enormous bubble.

Fiat currencies have no intrinsic value; they have literally nothing backing it at all. Unless somehow you think violence is backing. There are some legal requirements that give it some value (because you must pay taxes in it); Its just special paper with some hightech inks; but beyond that the value of dollars are entirely psychological.

Bitcoin on the other hand is backed by energy; Bitcoin is Stored Work. Not only is it just random "Stored Work" ; but the work thats stored is the work of securing itself! In addition to being backed by energy and work; Bitcoin exists independent of any State. Countries can come and go; but Bitcoin is not dependent on any. Bitcoins incentive system makes it very likely that people will keep working for Bitcoin for decades if not hundreds or even thousands of years from now.

The world needs a global reserve currency ; and we need a currency that cannot be manipulated by corrupt individuals. That is why we have Bitcoin. Bitcoin cannot be changed; it cannot be bent to the whims of any politician. They can't inflate or deflate it. Bitcoin is money independent of politics. Bitcoin is the Jubilee the world has been waiting for.

Hmmm, this last small rise actually looks organic. Not the usual big price pumps that happen from a handful of wallets in 20 minutes.
Interesting. I like it.
Right this moment, that graph ends in the form of a perfect fish hook.  Who's gonna bite?

So, what happened to $20k by end of July?

Today we are exploring the notion of bitcoin regret. 


Don’t be like the two guys below.  This could be your moment to shine.  Bitcoin is on the low side of a major correction like it has done many times before.  All I know is, I’m still buying.  Are you?

Lol that was my first thought. But i understand his pain, i was introduced to bitcoin in 2010. I thought it was a scam. Now I have some very rich friends -_-

I went to a hackerspace in SF back in 2011. Me and some of the guys went to the bar across the way and talked about bitcoin over a few beers. The party was separated into two camps: one who was holding BTC already and advocated for others to do the same, and the others who put their nose up at the idea. Sadly I was a part of the second group...

Can someone explain to me the difference between GBTC (the Bitcoin investment trust) and a Bitcoin ETF? Everyone seems pumped about a Bitcoin ETF because it will open easy investment to the public but I thought that we already had that with GBTC.

I don't trust these spikes anymore. Maybe I got conditioned to fear any sudden rise in price, since lately they've all been followed by a horrible drop.

**Bitcoin Again Shows Green Shoots After $6K Defense**

https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-again-shows-green-shoots-after-6k-defense/

Bitcoin's (BTC) sharp recovery from two-week lows has raised the odds of a stronger rally towards $6,400, technical studies indicate.

As of writing, the leading cryptocurrency is changing hands at $6,245 on Bitfinex.

BTC was expected to drop below $6,000 in the last 24 hours as the bears were on the offensive following an inverted flag breakdown.

However, the intraday oversold conditions likely put a floor under bitcoin prices at the two-week low of $6,080, helping it chart a solid rebound to $6,283 (today's high).

While it is too early to call a bullish reversal, the change of fortune has saved the day for the BTC bulls. Moreover, the probability of BTC's price charting a picture-perfect inverse head-and-shoulders bullish reversal pattern would have dropped sharply had BTC found acceptance below $6,000.

Further, the sharp recovery from $6,080 to $6,283 has opened the doors to re-test of $6,400, the price chart analysis indicates.

View

BTC could attack the $6,400 mark, but further gains are ruled out for now as the descending (bearish) 5-day MA and 10-day MA are located at $6,366 and $6,500, respectively.

That said, if BTC manages to close (as per UTC) today above 10-day MA, then the doors would open for a re-test of the Monday's high of $6,820.

Bearish scenario: A failure to produce a significant move higher despite the bullish price RSI divergence and the falling wedge breakout would shift risk in favor of a drop to a recent low of $5,755. The downside move will likely gather pace if BTC fails to hold above $6,080 (previous day's high) over the weekend.
We will no longer let them hold us down.  Stand here and stand strong.  We will hodl through the storm, and hodl for the people once and for all!

Anyone who buys bitcoin but doesn’t own stocks or manage their own stocks is destined to lose all their money. You are “get rich quick” players driven by hype and momentum. My mother in law wanted to buy BTC in December. Instead, I helped her short bitcoin in the futures market around $16,500. It’s a trading vehicle. Nothing more. 
Cause they still don’t understand you can buy half or even a tenth of a Bitcoin. They see the high price of 1 and get scared off. Time to move the decimal point over.

Exactly who wants a currency subject to widespread manipulation and high volatility?
That's exactly why I'm accumulating Bitcoin.
"\[V\]iolence \_is\_ backing."  Just the name Austrian economics gives the game away.  Even if the economic principles are 100&#37; correct, economically (and otherwise) irrational states like Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union can have a greater influence.  And while it may be possible for states based on sound money to have defeated them, in our actual history it was Keynesian states that did. 
Ummm bitcoin pump and dump is manipulated like CRAZY by whales and people.
What you are saying isn't correct atm.
> We are already paying a significant fraction of the US budget to just pay the interest on our current debt. 7.4% of our total budget is spent just on the interest on the US debt. Each year this % rises

This means that bank's profits raise. They get real $ and use them to pay salaries and dividends to the bankers.

This is essentially a "tax on taxes" - banks receive taxes from the government.

> and at a certain point we will be faced with cutting other programs in order to just pay the interest on this debt.

Another option - to print more money (more debt).
US controlling the world currency I loled, Europe is not egal to only greece. Too many bs argument. BTW you don't understand how Europe is working. Focused on US is better than everything.

no, only a handfull of idiots see that.

>  this last small rise actually looks organic

small rise?

btc is down about $400 just this week

thats not a rise, bitcoin has been crashing (almost continuously) the last 6 months

and its STILL crashing hard

there are slight little upticks (or dead cat bounces) but there is no "rise"

BTC is just going down, more and more, with no end in site

The bulls :)
Sound yummy 
Same as the $20k predictions by the end of April, May and June.
McAfee said $15k by the end of July which is obviously not going to happen now.
If you're naive enough to believe the extreme in either direction of price movement then you're obviously new to this space. While Bitcoin, in terms of the crypto market side of things, has made many radical price moves, nobody has ever accurately predicted them.
be careful since that hopium is addicting, you're going to create a lot of new hopium addicts :)
GBTC trades at a premium to its underlying bitcoin holdings because shares of it aren't created/redeemed on a regular basis.  An ETF would allow APs (authorized participants) to create and redeem shares of the ETF so that it would trade much closer to the value of its underlying holdings.

Thus, an ETF would mostly eliminate the risk of expansion/contraction of the price premium and provide exposure just to the BTC price.
GBTC trades at a premium, or theoretically could trade at a discount to the real market price of bitcoin.  This entry says it was on average a 62.98&#37; premium over the last 52 weeks.  A more normal etf would presumably have a net asset value at (or close to) the market price and would buy and sell bitcoin as investors deposit or withdraw money. [https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/GBTC:US](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/GBTC:US)
Questions like these are good for Bitcoin.
They have used it partially, but so what. They've been using cash for years. Cash is far more anonymous than crytpo. Every crypto transaction is recorded on the blockchain, and less than 1% of all transaction are linked to any illegal activity.
no Americans were involved

all took place under obama

Good news for Trump (which, generally speaking, is good news for America)

This is nothing to do with whether or not someone on here likes Trump, or not (thats anybody's free choice to like the guy or not)

I'm just saying, Trump (once again) being shown to have nothing to do with so-called "russian collusion" is good news, and stabilizing

That it all took place under obama's watch, is bad news for obama and his legacy, but as obama is out of power for good, it doesnt really affect the world economy or international relations

a stable world is good for all investments (except gold, which could go either way if thing are unstable) but this news showing Trump to not be involved is good for the crypto assets markets in general
I wouldn’t be surprised if crypto *tanked* now. 

This is an inherent vulnerability of crypto, and why I feel that we’ll never see it truly take off - too high of a potential for the anonymity to be abused by criminals. 
Yep, you are not wrong, I would say morale is very low at the moment.  
The morale has been gone and resurrected many many times in the past several years. It's business as usual for anyone that's been on this train for a while.
 You mean guys who wear hats backwards are crying into their trust funds because they bought 6 months ago when the one guy in their frat who is totally working on his MBA like for real told them to buy?
I’m happy as fuck 
> The overall morale in the space is almost at zero.

yeah, bitcoin is down 70% from where it was just a few months ago

and its still crashing HARD

Losing hundreds in value daily

so yeah... what a mystery, I can't imagine why morale would be so low?


Umkay
yep, this can easily go to 1K or less
Roger Ver's Bcash scam site.  Nothing would surprise me.
lol

sure

whatever you say

you are aware that bitcoin is deep into a hard crash, with no evidence of an end in sight?

but hey... if acting as if everything is ok helps you, but all means, don't let me interrupt your play-pretend 
..."they have a live server and a live roadmap" 

good to know the roadmap is now "live" 
 I thought they called a bitcoin funeral and weren’t covering it anymore? 
makes sense to me.  The monthly is in a pretty tight range and I imagine the more days the price stays above 6k or even 5800 the better the chances that the bottom is in and all the pompous entitled finance guys who think they are so smart cause they are going to load up once it goes back to 5k or lower will have to buy in at these prices.  Would like nothing more than for people like ElErian and others to totally miss out
Rally towards 6400, LOL. My how expectations have fallen

this bear is really bad,,  i want to hunt all the bear in this world so no more bear,

Turd 
Clever, man. Have not heard this before.
Ah, but each backwards step increases the possible future upside, LOL.
Just because this is your first year, don't assume that there none of us that don't know the difference. The huge run up in December created massive gains for a lot of people who are profit taking. This can happen many times until Bitcoin becomes more than just a coin to trade in the market. Recent infrastructure has been underway on a bigger scale these last few years. It won't be much longer before Bitcoin becomes much more useful than it currently is, and this pump and dump scenarios will fade into the past.
That also means someone is buying hundreds at once. 
Scam alert, those buying up are the next bait in the downwards price dive
You are an idiot.
You wouldn't be saying that if you were in the green. Hypocrisy at its finest.
so why are you here, then?
Heh.  I reckon my 4 year old gaming laptop could make me, hey, maybe 0.1 cent per month gross.  And that's before I pay for the extra electricity.  
The symptoms you are refering to is a product of low volume and should theoretically go away as volume increases over time and more BTC is accumulated by institutions who are less likely to sell
Yeah. Owning a lot of btc is way more uncomfortable than using the fiat to buy land......
Come on, give the guy some credit ... he actually took the time to write two pages.  Although most of it are cut and paste.

Nah, JK... there's nothing organic in this market... people should have known that by now...
There's no bull anymore in Bitcoin

in a few years we'll be lucky if one bitcoin is even worth $500

^ what he said. Finally a solid answer. You'd be amazed at the freak show answers I've seen for this question. Thanks for keeping it straight and Not just jumping on the ETF FUD train :)
Not all crypto uses blockchain - but regardless, sophisticated users of crypto can easily anonymize their transactions and move vast sums through TOR.  with Bitcoin you can skip intermediaries and all those pesky "know your customer" laws and headaches of having to be legitimate when using the banking system.  

Using cash is hard (for illegitimate transactions), and gets harder all the time.  Gone are the days of anonymous Swiss numbered bank accounts.  Moving physical cash is logistically challenging.  

In fact, the only real way to monitor bitcoin is when it interacts with the banking system.  Otherwise huge sums of money can be moved anonymously without any interference.  
"no Americans were involved"

I said 12 Russians. . .so, yeah? 

"all took place under obama"

in support of Trump 

"Good news for Trump (which, generally speaking, is good news for America)"

That's an interesting read. . .

"This is nothing to do with whether or not someone on here likes Trump, or not (thats anybody's free choice to like the guy or not)"

I get the feeling you like him!

"I'm just saying, Trump (once again) being shown to have nothing to do with so-called "russian collusion" is good news, and stabilizing"

Uh, no. . .it doesn't show that at all.  It shows 12 additional Russians muddled in our election (with connection to an unnamed Trump campaign associate).  It says nothing dispositive about Trump.

"That it all took place under obama's watch,"

You already said that. 

"but this news showing Trump to not be involved is good for the crypto assets markets in general". 

It doesn't show Trumps involvement or lack there of at all - this is directed at 12 Russian agents.  




I'm pretty sure 99% of laundered money is fiat. You make no sense.
Cash gets used for hundreds of thousands maybe millions of dodgy deals every day, shall we ban cash as well? 
Ha ha that rumor came from a shady website that accepted crypto ages ago and has since been proven inaccurate.

In fact, less than 1% of all Bitcoin transactions have been used or even linked to any criminal activity. There was also a study published by the Foundation for Defense of Democracies that showed this along with other investigations into the use of crypto.

How can people still be saying this? You should not just hear some rumor and spread it on without verifying it.

You are likely speculating, not gambling. There is a difference. 
poop
Can somebody explain why bitcoin would be more than just hype trading asset? Its not useful for storage f value or medium of exchange due to price fluctuations. You have to pay hefty fees to acquire it. Fees to get your $ back. Whats the point? What is it for, really? My answer is - nothing. Sorry, dear HODLers. 
Cost of infrastructure has zero impact on price.

Just ask Dubai about their huge property investments and debt restructuring as it went insolvent.
It can be short positions being closed.  But yes, still considered buying.
Not quite, because there is an order book which is depleted by the immediate sells
I’m here for the comments.  
You can't get that concept through the heads of anyone with one-dimensional thinking. They only see the way it is now and think that because the Bitcoin network has been running 10 years it should already be successful. But it took the internet about 40 years, and this is money we're talking about..
 and that is an even harder thing to transition. It's coming though. Anyone that can't see it yet will have to open their eyes eventually.
Yes, heard that one before ...  "institutions".

Well, the only "institutions" doing any investing are investing in platforms to earn fees.  I mean, if they can make money from suckers, why not?
It's possible, but there is no proof. Most likely they don't operate with fractional reserve like banks, because it's very dangerous to their business.

But sometimes humans make bad decisions, so nothing is certain.

Lol ...the drop is fine, the organic growth gave profit takers another opportunity. Volume is the only saving grace this market can have, and that may come from news, LN, ETF, SEC ....who knows. Maybe it'll even just happen over time. But volume will destroy these shorts and I'm confident we'll get there in time.
I dunno man.  I’ve held coin for 6 months. Through uPs and downs. I used it tonight for about the 25th time.  It’s stupid fast. Accurate.  Prime time easy buying shit.   It works for me.  Why do I need cast.  Not fiat. Cash 
I hope you aren’t serious.
tbf the ETF will be managed by the same lesbian Anunnaki who killed JFK and faked the moon landing, so I can understand people's concerns.

^^^^^/s
That's because anything that fiat can do, Bitcoin can do better :)
Oh, and any crypto that doesn't use a blockchain can be banned ... it doesn't even count in my opinion.
ok, you want to make this political

please stick to how it affects btc or not

but all this talk about [russia collusion](https://imgur.com/u7mapmq) belongs on a conspiracy subreddit, not on here, where we limit talk to crypto assets and things that are related to them and their performance

thanks!
Cash is difficult to move surreptitiously. which is why they used crypto.  
Cash can be traced somewhat 
So True! - 'The only thing people hate more than losing money, is the person who lost it for them.' Anonymous

and lets not forget,

its already lost about $400 in value *just this week*,

and it seems like the current crash we are in is still going on, and each new day is a lowering of value 
My pool guy says the Big RV may be this weekend, and is the real reason that Trump is meeting with European leaders and Putin.
I confess. I'm no dummy.
> My answer is - nothing. Sorry, dear HODLers. 

It's okay. I'm sorry too.

I tried years ago arguing with people saying what you're saying. I tried so hard to help them to understand that BTC would eventually do exactly what it did in December last year.

Around January, I started getting excited messages. "So I finally bought Bitcoin." I screamed internally (and externally at the closer ones). 

Actual retardation. Who the fuck thinks that kind of growth is sustainable and a good thing to buy?

I would have told them to wait for the bulls to leave. Wait until a day when despair coloured the air, blood filled the streets, and Buttcoiners filled our daily thread. It is their time now.

"This, too, shall pass." Not just the bear phase. The whole thing. The back and forth. One of these days, the bears are going to "win" for good. But Bitcoin isn't going to zero. It's just going to 10% of its final ATH... and staying there. 

I hope for my friends' sake that we've got one more in us. But thanks to not listening to dinosaurs and scared liberals 5 years ago, I am much better off today than I was when Bitcoin was first declared a "scam." 



This is the same thing people always say about new technologies. All the issues you mentioned will eventually be addressed. It would not be possible to advance any faster than it currently is. I remember how we mused about video chatting back when the internet was dial up. I also remember even earlier, loads of people not being able to grasp the internet as a useful tool. There were newspaper articles claiming the internet was the biggest waste of electricity the world has ever known and that it would not amount to anything. Yet here we are.
It's simple. Infrastructure in technology helps onboard users. Sort of how a step helps you reach a high door. Nothing to do with affecting the price in the way you're coming at it.
It is still buying. Nobody ever sells more than someone else buys or vice versa. For every seller there is a willing buyer.  
Fair point.  
for your own comments? to see how many people you can troll, or rile up? from a cursory reading of your post, it seems you're part of the "get rich quick" crowd as well.
Assumes that in a year BTC will not be on this list at http://www.deadcoins.com
Institutions have not bought because their framework for buying is different from a retail buyer. We're talking about an asset that takes education, training, and new internal controls to prevent fraud, theft, hacks, etc. It's risky for more reasons than simply its volatility or volume. With custodial services and exchange traded funds, the ease of purchase and reduced liability will make purchase of actual Bitcoin more attractive.
Why is the drop fine?  I think it sucks pretty badly! 
Hah. J/k man.  Was taking a short break in Hopium rehab 
if you're a criminal, this is undoubtably true.  For everyone else, the banking system is infinitely easier and more efficient.  
It's not a conspiracy, lols they obviously have evidence if they can indict them. Feds don't play. That orange troll is getting fucked.


You made it political. Just like a Trump supporter to accuse someone of something they themselves did. 
What Russian bot farm are you working out of anyway?  

"ok, you want to make this political". 

Uh, no, that was you.  I just responded to your nonsense.

"please stick to how it affects btc or not"

I posted it above w/o comment.  Since you asked, it's pretty clear that crypto's killer app is illicit transactions.  This is the latest example.  

"but all this talk about russia collusion belongs on a conspiracy subreddit"

I brought up the crypto angle.  You brought in the politics son. 
So can crypto.
BTC can go up $500 in minutes.
Mining pool or mempool?
Your pool guy certainly has a lot to say for himself.
8 year old tech is not "New".

And adoption is not only negligible but dropping.  The only use case for BTC now is speculating on exchanges.
And why would anyone bother since there are far superior tech already available?

BTC's 8 year old tech is a dinosaur with bandaids and as a currency, acceptance by merchants is pathetic and dropping.  
Not what I meant
No he just trade stock to learn how to invest
Lol not even close. I did make a sweet trade on bitcoin, but it was mostly luck. I subscribe to a service with one of the top traders in the world. Hell-a worth it. If you want more details about that then message me. I can help you win your money back. Otherwise, just posting my opinion that Bitcoin is not an investment. It was a bubble for this generation like Pets.com was for another. 
Sure. That's actually the most insane thing I've heard. Would you like to bet?
I agree with you on the need for regulations to eliminate fraud, etc.

But you are wrong in that ETF will solve the problem.  As long as the underlying asset can't be effectively regulated, building an ETF on top of it amplifies the risk, not solve it.  And it's because of this very reason that SEC has so far refused to allow a BTC ETF.
Because it's a natural part of markets. This is going to happen a lot, but make no mistake, a glance around the globe points clearly to Bitcoin becoming a very big part of society over the next decade. So I say accept the price movement and let time do its job.
It was much easier to use a horse and buggy before paved roads and highway infrastructure to accommodate cars at high speed transportation too. Give it time. The internet took 40 years to go mainstream and another 20 to accommodate bandwidth for today's many applications. Crytpo roots already run too deep for it to go away, and realistically, it can't be any further adopted than it is at this point in time.
Yeah they have so much evidence they just want to sit on their asses with it instead of prosecuting people connected with Trump so that the actual basis for starting the special counsel in the first place can be justified. It isn't just a partisan tool that is slowly dying and becoming less credible to anyone with half a brain, that was started by unelected unaccountable bureaucrats who have already been shown to be liars and snakes (Comey and Strzok) who were themselves using corrupt means to influence the election. Such as using easily discreditable opposition research paid for by the Clinton campaign to justify a FISA warrant to spy on the Trump campaign.

They aren't just keeping the dying show alive by trotting out anything they can even if it's irrelevant to the collusion tinfoil theory, to prevent the Dems mid term "blue wave" from becoming even more flaccid than it already has once they end the charade. The FBI and DOJ were so concerned about Russian interference during the election and immediately after, that virtually none of their internal communications that have been released show them discussing it at all, far from it there was only partisan banter about how they must stop Trump by conspiring themselves. 

You're totally not just a low info fake news consuming retard. Stay delusional, I like seeing libs perpetually surprised and hammered by reality.
Very much so, more then people realize.. wouldn't be surprise if crypto was major part of the evidence to indict.
sure, and it could go to $0 in minutes, too

I don't think it will (go to zero)

but down to $2000 by the end of 2018?

yes, in my opinion, thats very likely
Water pool, although I think he's putting bromide into it to prevent algae.
Oh, he is quite talkative and totally positive about his "investments" such as they are.
We'll see. I'm not going to explain why 8 years is not only new, but in an infancy stage kind of new. There was no existing and working concept of Bitcoin to build on, it's the first one.
All this crypto ecosystem is new really. It's very easy to forget that.
Ever see the 8 year old concept of the internet? How about the 8 year old concept of the airplane? car? 3D Printing is still evolving, it generates a buzz every 4-5 years and just fades out of mainstream media over and over. It's still NEW. How about the cell phone after 8 years? Could you do banking on cell phones only 8 years after they were conceived? THINK before you type. It's not 8 year old tech, it's an 8 year old concept. The tech (hardware and software of the network) is being upgraded all the time, and will continue to ongoing. Get it now? It's the network that organically upgrades because the mining rigs and code will be upgraded for the remainder of its existence ... whether that's 1 month or 1000 years.
Ha ha. Reality will hit you harder than most. It takes years to prove it has the potential before real effort goes into it. There's no research and development team budget like a corporation. The creators are open source coders. But that is also it's biggest strength and why it will only continue to improve until it fulfills the role of a real solution. Believe it, don't believe it. Nobody really cares what either of us think. This stuff happens with or without us.

Exactly. There are a lot of companies that are moving certain operations to Blockchain for reasons and purposes that have utterly nothing to do with BTC, and hodlrs of BTC don't make a tenth of a penny in technology royalties from businesses using Blockchain. The most likely result is that the transaction costs of dealing with government currencies will decrease in areas such as wire-transfers, currency conversions, and credit card transactions, which will further obviate the need for BTC. Then, of course, there are BTC's numerous other problems such as susceptibility to market manipulation, high volatility, and the linger reputation of an "investment" that costs many thousands of people many billions of dollars (or their local currency) worldwide. Bitcoin may survive at some level for dark activities, but BTC's chances of replacing any significant governmental currency is probably much less than 1 in 10,000.
It's hilarious that you still think Bitcoin is about being Paypal 2.0. Time for you to dig more into it instead of wasting time on this sub.
> I subscribe to a service with one of the top traders in the world
>  It was a bubble for this generation like Pets.com was for another.

pick one you inbicil

If you can call Bitcoin a bubble, you can call everything a bubble. Funny how that goes. Banks are a bubble. Housing is a bubble. Investment is a bubble. Humanity is a bubble.

On the "winning my money back" issue: I don't have any money lost due to Bitcoin, to be completely honest. The only time I actually lost money was when I had to deal with banks (be it bank affiliates, like exchanges, or banks themselves).

I've also had multi-annual forays into the local stock markets and forex markets, with and without professional advisors and traders. I've lost more money (in the thousands of GBP) due to their professional advice than ever before or since. So, thanks, but no, thanks.
Heh.  Fake.  You sound like the bad guy at the end of Scooby Doo:

'Lol not even close, kids'  'I did make a sweet trade on that ol' haunted goldmine though'

Lol.  Trolling loser.
Already betting by shorting BTC.
You are absolutely right, but I am optimistic that future regulatory framework will make Bitcoin more attractive. I think the most recent battery of crypto-related hearing at Congress and by the SEC in the US reinforce the idea that Bitcoin will be better regulated in the future
> a natural part of markets. 

An asset losing 70% of its value in a little over 6 months is not a natural part of any healthy market

And an asset that has been continuously crashing hard for six months straight is not a part of any healthy market, either

Thats its STILL crashing hard (-$400 just this week) is not a natural part of any healthy market either

I am not saying BTC will never come back (i don't know) but its in a VERY unhealthy and bad condition right now, and there is no sign that this severe drop in value will be letting up any time soon (or ever).

First step is acceptance, and we have to get out of denial and admit that bitcoin is in a death spiral, or in very serious, serious trouble, at the very least.
Very hard to be optimistic at the moment.
I think the only likely way that crypto becomes widely adopted and something other than a black market chit/nerd bucks is when central banks adopt/control/regulate actual crypto that is real currency under the control of central banks, not pseudo currencies that are really digital commodities.  
Its an independent investigation you half brain, read the news stop reading 4chan and r/the_donald and fox "news" that shit is fucking lying to you if you believe it, for entertainment I get it, but to fuckin believe that shit. You are destroying our country if you truly believe this man and his ideologies, and spread his hate, you will fuck us so hard. and by us us i mean your neighbors your coworkers, your friends, family. We will be fucked. You are probably a russian troll, working on russian troll farm, spreading fake information. Fuck you and i hope you die.
Beats me.  The price is so heavily manipulated, you can never figure out what games they are playing.
Please just take a look at the tech 8 years ago and where we are at now.  Sorry but the world has moved on and BTC is now just a dinosaur.

BTC's application as a currency has failed.  It's now just a digital token speculated on exchanges.


Zzzzzzz ....

I really think you should learn more about tech beyond BTC youtubes.
Dark activites lol. And nobody said it needs to replace anything. It need to provide an alternative that is well aligned with multiple types of transactions, without any global or total amount restrictions.
I don't anticipate your mind opening up much past what is currently in place. You need to remind yourself that many technologies we use today weren't even imagined when we were kids.
Let me see ...

BTC - 8yo tech and need bandaids like Lightning to scale (current architecture is obsolete).  Using a medium that is not accepted by 99.99% of merchants.  Generated $0 for shareholders.

Paypal - Processed $451B of payments for real products and services last year.  Using currencies that are acceptable by every major vendor.  Generated $620m for shareholders.

You are right, the comparison is hilarious.  And Paypal is not even considered cutting edge and is falling behind.
Lol pretty much i guess! Good luck to ya. 
Ok so then you're not willing to bet that Bitcoin will be on that list? Because you know fucking well that it won't be. Unless you really truly believe something, don't say it, otherwise you're just spewing verbal diarrhea.
Look S&P 500 at 2007-2009.
In serious trouble how? There's more infrastructure, mining software, SEC acknowledgment, peer to peer exchanges, etc, then ever before. The open source community for Bitcoin is stronger than ever, and the Lightning Network is the beginning of much more layering and improvements coming down the pipe. There have been well respected business people claiming Bitcoin will be an excellent fit for real estate transactions among many applications. We don't even have wallet address translation yet, and non technical people have no user friendly platform for onboarding, but it's clearly coming. 
Focusing only in the coin price is silly, but there's the fact that Bitcoin jas crashed like this many many times, in fact it's crashed worse at a 90% drop once. We are in early days, but I do understand that a quick look at the outside view of this would lead one to feel pessimistic. Just remember, in the early days of cars, the speed limit was only 20 mph, because they didn't want to spook the horses.
Why?  It's the same price as it was last month. Sideways movement usually proceeds upward movement. In any case it seems to have leveled out somewhere between 5500 and 6500. 

Listen, and if you believe anything you read on here or wherever, please know this:

Bitcoin is NOT going away. There's a lot of shit I don't know, a lot. But I have an excellent understanding of how technology evolves and integrates with society. I am telling you right now .. Bitcoin is not going away. Anyone that says it is, well the real bubble is the one they're living in.
That's just you refusing to consider other possibilities outside what your brain has been exposed to. You do realize that if everyone thought that way, we'd have none of the innovations we enjoy today.
If a new generation that's been raised in a digital culture embrace Bitcoin, then it will be adopted. It's global and non centralized. I don't think it will replace the fiat system in all countries of the world any time soon, but it will almost certainly run along side as an alternative currency that is not tied to any one country or region.
I fully support  Bitcoin and see where it is headed, but as a network security specialist for years, I sometimes also see it as something that is possibly one of the most robust entities to ever come out of mankind's imagination. Think about what it has already survived... the negativity, and the paid studies from the BIS, all the crap thrown at it to beat it down over the years..yet it just keeps growing bigger and bigger (not the coin price, I mean the entity). One thing I know for sure...Bitcoin will outlive you and I.

I think crypto will stop being used as much when the banks get involved. What will really take crypto up is when more shops, bars, services, etc start letting you pay in crypto
yes, they can manipulate it a lot

they might just break it, totally (and then the price will go down to zero)

they can't manipulate it too much (for example, they can't manipulate it up to $50K)

for now, I think they'll just manipulate it, up and down (like they are doing now), do lots of pump and dumps for a couple of years, and make billions off of the regular investors, and speculators

eventually, everyone will know its a scam, and no one will want BTC, and it will die.

at that point the scammers and whales will just move on to their next scam, and the average investors and *true believers* will be left penniless
I did that before there was YouTube. You're really reaching now hey.
Correct, but many are, see, e.g., wheel.

But, hey, don't be blinded by greed or anything.
The confirmation you have provided that people with your pinpointed and tunneled scope of information to draw conclusions from even exist makes me all the more grateful for the inventors and innovators we have in this world.
Base layer is not even tech but sound money/Gold 2.0 (Tech only starts from L1 and beyond) so your direct comparison of fintech vs Bitcoin base layer fail hard. Please try again. 
Who knows? Suckers bought those other cryptos too thinking they were valuable.
yes, just because the most stable investment instrument ever bounced back is hardly proof that the very new, and unstable BTC will also bounce back

you do know that, right?
> In serious trouble how?

its crashing

its been crashing for 6 months straight

and its still crashing hard

all those reasons don't overcome the reality that btc is down 70% since last winter

you can try to excuse how were in a crash that shows no signs of ending, but that still doesnt excuse how it is doing so poorly, with no end in sight!
It's very hard to be optimistic because we have been going down hill since mid December and the price has crashed around 70%!  10-20% I could accept but 70% is a bloody lot! 
> It's the same price as it was last month

wrong

its worth $400 LESS than it was last month

and its still spiraling downward

its been going down nearly non-stop for 6 months straight, and its still crashing hard

you can have faith in BTC or not, but we need to get out of denial and at least admit that bitcoin is in serious trouble, and there is no evidence that this crash will be ending anytime soon.
"You do realize that if everyone thought that way, we'd have none of the innovations we enjoy today."

That's an absurdity.  I can distinguish between things that advance society and things that can be extraordinarily destructive.

"If a new generation that's been raised in a digital culture embrace Bitcoin, then it will be adopted."

Don't smoke your own supply man.

"It's global and non centralized."

So?  I can use dollars anywhere and even when I can't they're easily convertible.  Transactions are instantaneous and with minimal fees. 

"but it will almost certainly run along side as an alternative currency that is not tied to any one country or region."

I don't dispute that a tiny fraction of overall transactions will continue to happen in nerd bucks.  People still operate ham radio.  Doesn't mean it's all that meaningful in grand scheme of things.

"I fully support Bitcoin and see where it is headed."  

Good for you.

"but as a network security specialist for years, I sometimes also see it as something that is possibly one of the most robust entities to ever come out of mankind's imagination."

If security is the concern bitcoin should scare the fuck out of you.  

"One thing I know for sure...Bitcoin will outlive you and I."

So will ham radio.  

Hahahaha.

Dude - y'all need to drop this delusion.  Crypto isn't money and will never be used as such (except for a relative handful of nerds).

Like, think about this for 10 fucking seconds.  

1.  It's WAY too volatile to ever be currency.  Only a small fraction of people will have the risk tolerance to be in at all. 

2.  Every transaction is a taxable event.  Every. Single. Transaction.  Now you're going to have to transform whole segments of society that fill out a 1040 ez form into 1040 with long schedule Cs - tax headaches for people who make basic wages?  LOL no.

3.  People who hodl bitcoin won't want to spend on the way up (my pizza will be worth 20% more tomorrow!) or the way down (I'll lose 10% if I buy that cupcake).  Either way - this isn't transactional currency.  And that's just for everyday transactions.  Try closing a fucking complicated financing deal with bitcoin?  It would be a fucking nightmare - trust me, I do this for a living.  How are you going to pick a price months out on an asset that can gain or lose as much as 20% in a fucking day?  

4.  It's complicated.  Oh, sure a few nerds will get into it.  Got to think about Aunt Sally.  WTF does Aunt Sally know about hard wallets, soft wallets, cold storage, exchanges, hard forks, soft forks, 51% attacks, lightning network. . .it's going to make her head spin.  You know what Aunt Sally does when her head starts to spin?  That's right she orders a gin and tonic and pays for it with good old fashioned greenbacks.

To be attractive, currency must be stable.  Currency is also (slowly) inflationary for very good reasons.  Y'all need to stop conflating investments with currency - really bad idea, never going to work.  As a practical matter, the only thing people actually do with bitcoin is trade it. 

That and engage in illicit activities - bitcoin will be useful for black markets, human trafficking, terrorism, drug trade. . . that is a useful feature of bitcoin.  Without a doubt illicit acts are bitcoin's killer app, and for that reason alone I predict heavy heavy regulations.

But other than that, the broad population doesn't need it and won't adopt it.  
True believers don't care about the price (so they claim).

But yes, it's a scam.  90% of trading is carried out on Chinese exchanges with no addresses and using Tether, which has refused audit.  If these aren't red flags, I don't know what is.
Stop using your parent's credit cards to buy Bitcoin. 
You been watching too much "BTC gurus" on Youtube.
Sure, keep calling a digital token "sound money".

Strange that this "sound money" is worth $0 to 99.99% of the merchants. 
But that was because they were hoping on the small change ce that just maybe one of them would stick and get a pump to make them a quick profit.
Basically ... people were hoping to find the next Bitcoin. But Bitcoin is the authentic currency blockchain and finally has that first decade of network stability under its belt to provide confidence to warrant the investment of more effort from coders to build it into what it needs to be. It has the foundation that no other crypto has come remotely close to achieving. Nobody needs to worry about Bitcoin going away. It only just reached a point where it can really begin scaling.
Well maybe history doesn't always repeat but it is undisputed as an excellent source of how patterns occur. As I mentioned, Bitcoin has crashed as much as 90% in the past, only to come back stronger... and that was before the enhanced infrastructure of today.
I gave example of something that crashes over 50% and then going up. There are many examples, look for example what happened to AIG stock between 2007 and 2018.

50-60-80% crash is not equal to death.
Stocks are based on real company performance, like revenue and profits.

As long as the company is performing, the share price will correct itself and recover.

BTC price is based on pure speculation.  There's nothing that can stop it from reaching $0 or $1m.
So that's what you got from my comment hey? The coin price has little to do with the future of Bitcoin. The price will follow the adoption in due time. In fact according to the coders and the exchanges, they take full advantage of these lower volumes to focus on improving the infrastructure. 
Anyway, you are just looking with tunnel vision at the market and not at Bitcoin,  so there seems to be little point in this discussion.
I know buddy, but if you step back it's just the most realistic example of what a correction is... it went up too much too fast and we're getting back to a more realistic movement. With the fast pace of infrastructure development in the crypto space, the next bull run will be much more solid. It'll happen, and with real investment and real world applications.
agreed

things are bad, and there is no evidence that this hard crash downward will be ending anytime soon (or ever)

sadly, many on here are in denial, and will not open their eyes to the truth the BTC is in very bad shape right now
In serious trouble how? There's more infrastructure, mining software, SEC acknowledgment, peer to peer exchanges, etc, then ever before.

Sorry but it is approximately the same price as mid June and now it's mod July. Zoom out on a chart and you can clearly see downward movement up to mid June, and from there it been bouncing around between 5800 to 6800. But hey who knows.
Ah how sweet, you addressed every point I made.. with completely absurd and irrational responses, but you at least tried. I mean, there are people that think the earth is flat, and with the right wording, can make it sound half convincing to an 8 year old.
Oh, and the fact that you call it nerd bucks says more than anyone needs to know about how your limited brain functions. They used to call PC users nerd tools for years. Those computer things never amounted to anything either. Am I right?
Hey man is everything ok with you at home? You are awfully worked up over a difference in opinion, and when you get worked up you have a tendency to wildly speculate about people's spending habits
agreed

its an obvious scam

sadly, i was one of the suckers who was fooled (I lost 60% of what i put in)

Oh well... i'm not a fool like those saying "just HODL" and "just wait, i'll go to the moon any day"

LOL

year right

its not going to the moon, its going into the toilet

I'm so totally OVER BTC, it was such a scam, I'm just sad for myself and all the good people who were fooled into losing our money

And yes... I take FULL personal responsibility, its still sad that scammers are now rich through money they lied to achieve

OH well... all i can say is #neveragain
huh?

why would you even say such an uneducated and rude comment?

seriously, this is a community, meaning we do NOT personally insult each other

we talk about the actual issues, like BTC and crypto assets

we don't personally insult each other.

As for your insulting comment, yes I lost 60% of what I put into bitcoin

but I'll survive just fine, as I only bought what i could afford to lose, I NEVER bought with anybody's credit card (the fees were higher if you bought with a CC) and I only bought BTC with cash I had on hand in bank accounts.

Oh... and I only bought with my own money.

Luckily I kept most of my money is invested in Vanguard, mining that I make about 6% interest (which is WAY better than the minus60% return that bitcoin offers).

so, yes... i lost some money in bitcoin, and I think bitcoin is STILL going down. (in my non-expert opinion, I think bitcoin will keep crashing for the next few years, until it reaches zero, or near-zero, eventually).

But, I will talk about it, WITHOUT having to resort to name calling on here.

I can only wish you the best, and say that I sincerely hope that you can learn to be more polite in the days to come.

Have never watched even one. I catch the occasional Joe Rogan Pod and music in a third sideline monitor while working but that's about it.
Sure keep hogging on to your Keynesian economics. Its just a matter before you drown in your salty tears.
If you call a couple of mining pools in China operating out of unlabelled warehouses a "foundation", yeah sure.
That's simply because of price manipulation, not organic.
true

and it seems like its heading towards $0 a lot faster than its heading to $1M

I don't think it will go to zero, but its definitely been crashing a long time, and continues to crash even now
I hope so :) 
> things are bad, and there is no evidence that this hard crash downward will be ending anytime soon (or ever)

dumb money is capitulating, the end is near!
You must be really desperate to be spamming this crap 24x7.
> In serious trouble how?

its crashing

its been crashing for 6 months straight

and its still crashing hard

all those reasons don't overcome the reality that btc is down 70% since last winter

you can try to excuse how were in a crash that shows no signs of ending, but that still doesnt excuse how it is doing so poorly, with no end in sight!
"I mean, there are people that think the earth is flat" 

That's your takeaway, I'm a flat earther?  LOL

"about how your limited brain functions"

sick burn bro

"Those computer things never amounted to anything either. Am I right?"

Golly, nothing ever doesn't work out in the tech world. Every new innovation is a huge success - no dead ends here!  

Did you sell your leftover coins already? If not, better do it fast so the smart people that understand sound money can able to get it cheaper. No use for you to be having them when you consider it a scam. 

PS: I'll wave to you when you fomo in at 20k again in the future.
tofuspider is just a troll who randomly drops in and make nonsensical attacks based on troll logic.

He usually backs off into his little corner once you slam him with facts (he has only a limited arsenal of rhetorics that he cut and paste from websites).
You always say scam everywhere for days without even asking why has it not died for years? Educate yourself and ask for proper resources on the fundamentals on Bitcoin and I'll be glad to link them up to you. I'm sorry you fomo for some of it but I've been there too during the Gox era and during those time, I don't even have the coins to sell if you I want to. 

I can be polite/impolite if I want to. I don't give a shit. But be humble and ask for more information to educate yourself instead of spreading your claims without any supporting evidence. Your scam arguments has been debunked since years ago btw.
> As for your insulting comment, yes I lost 60% of what I put into bitcoin

you still posting here you fuckwit,gtfo somewhere else with your fud and not educated comments, no one cares about you, good bye

Wow!  Another cut & paste word!  Do you even understand Keynes?

Anyway, you still haven't provided a response to how a digital token that is rejected by 99.99% of merchants be considered "sound money".

Want to talk about decentralisation and the fact that China controls over 75% of the mining?  A country with an authoritarian government that can dictate to the miners to launch a 51% attack if they chose to?

"Sound money" .... my arse.
No that is not what I am referring to. You are not able to have this conversation. You are not equipped.
That's because it's a speculative price with no real floor.

In the absence of greater fools, price will go flat and then taper down (or crash) as people take profit or just cut their loss.  There is no basis for price to go up.
you laugh

i'm just staying actual facts

if you can't hang, thats on you!
Kind of my job. What's ironic is that I have not lost a penny in Bitcoin or crypto. I'm one of those rare "in it for the tech" freaks I guess. 
If I can shed light on Bitcoin for a few people who are confused, that's worth it. I'd never advise dumping money you cant afford to lose into it. I simply am educating people on a very likely possibility for the next decade.
Its crashed worse, and it will rise and likely crash again too. It will take several years before it functions as an alternative currency. So what?
You are pathetic and should never try and debate this with anyone ever again. Find something you understand.
Well, at least he's honest and can afford to lose.

It's quite clear to me through you salty posts that you lost more than you can afford.
wow

you just seem to want to go out of your way to be rude and insulting to a fellow bitcoin user

thats odd

i wonder why you are so perturbed by those who say bitcoin is gonna keep going down hard? (which its been doing ALL of 2018, and shows no sign of even slowing down - in anything, the crash seems to be speeding up)

anyway, no idea why that bothers you so.  I guess we'll never know

haha!

but, heres some friendly advice from a fellow member of r/bitcoin

"Be Polite and Friendly, and your experience here on r/bitcoin will be more pleasant for you, and for all of us"

As for selling my"leftover coins"

LOL

I have the same number of bitcoins, its just that their value has gone down (you do know how this whole bitcoin thing works, right?)  I haven't sold any yet, and I'll just hold on to them just in case.

Its not THAT much money, so even though I am pretty sure they'll go to zero, at this point, i'll just ride it out and HOLD, just in case it does somehow go up in value again.
oh, thanks u/JW4974

well, if thats what he is, and what he does, and if he's just fueled by angry and hatred, then his comments make sense.

i mean, not "sense" as in they're logical, but if he is just an angry troll, then his mindless insults make sense (as thats the sort of things a troll does do).

thanks for clarifying!!!

:) 
Troll calling another one a troll. Funny.  I stop because your arguments leads to nowhere most of the time since you are always in your echo chamber of retail payments.
> be humble

sorry, but i have a tremendous amount of healthy self-respect

as such, even if i wanted your advice (i'll politely decline) i would never take advice or guidance from someone who has been rude to me.

I do wish you the best in trying to get other people to listen to you, I (regrettably) will not be one of those people

...but best to you, peace!
> you fuckwit

we talk about the actual issues, like BTC and crypto assets

we don't personally insult each other.

stop breaking the rules

and as for saying things like "gtfo somewhere else with your fud"

no FUD?

LOL

sorry, pal

ALL opinions are allowed on here, not just people who blindly say "to the moon"

hahaha

seriously, you need to learn tolerance!

Users are in control not miners. Let them try a 51% attack and see how fast everyone would make their asics useless. 
Lol!  Ok, newbie.
agreed

its had its ups and down when it wasn't worth much

but once it spiked at 20K, people took their money

and the wiser ones looked into it for real

under scrutiny, it was obvious that it was based on nothing

and so the slow decent into nothing begins

all of 2018 has been a crash, with no end in sight

its just down, down, down

where will it stop?

i don't know.

my guess?

maybe about $2000 by end of 2018
Go learn more about fintech if you are really keen.  Cryptos are just a fringe movement and frankly, the butt of many jokes in the industry.
That's a fine retort for this era son.  You are right in line with the general tenor of what passes for discourse and discussion these days!

Good job, good effort!
You mentioned scam. It's not and there are many evidence to support why it's not. I'm not upset about the bear-market like you are and going about saying scam scam scam. If you are only not worried with your portion and going to ride it out, why the shitpost?
You're the one that seems angry calling it a scam without any supporting evidence for couple of days. I know it's hard to lose 60% when you fomo in near the high but if you ask properly, many would be able to help educate you on why Bitcoin is here to stay and why we think there's more upside than downside in the long-term.
BTC = Digital token + Broken transacting system that can't scale.

Which one do you want to talk about?  Digital token?
No hard feelings here. Hope your weekend goes well. I hope you don't fall for actual scams aka 99% of shitcoins out there in the future. :)

It's quite clear that you have no clue what a 51% attack will do to BTC.  Users in control?  LOL!  

51% attack will allow them to halt transactions and allow them to conduct transactional reversals and double spend.

Now couple that with the fact that the Chinese also owns 90% of the BTC trading on their exchanges.
sigh, you are so lame.
> You mentioned scam.

yes i did

bitcoin itself isn't the scam

but there are whales and syndicates that pump and dump, and manipulate the price

so... its a VERY shady marketplace

once people realize what a crooked system it is, they won't want to deal with it (especially with so many people losing so much - basically anyone who bought in late 2017 or all of 2018 has lost money - who wants to deal with that?)

Regular people don't want to deal with such a shady and heavily manipulated marketplace

so, i think the bottom will drop out even more (its already down 70%) until its down to near nothing.  There will be something better, but for the moment, BTC and similar is all we have, and it sucks!

fuck btc

Its just a big money loser, and just because some earlier adopters made money, doesn't mean it doesnt suck now

because.. heres a clue for ya, btc sucks now, and most of us who bought in when it was a "big deal" hate it now, and almost no one new wants to come into a marketplace thats lost 70% of its value in just under 7 months 

there is a difference between being critical of bitcoin (which I did) and being critical and personally insulting fellow users of r/bitcoin (which you did)

please understand that sharing a variety of opinions on bitcoin (good and bad) is what we do here

bitcoin is a made up thing, you don't need to rush to it's rescue every time someone is critical of bitcoin

if you think bitcoin is great, and i think it sucks, thats OK.  More than one opinion is allowed on here

after all, being tolerant of more than just one opinion or point of view is a more enlightened way to be.

I hope you are able to be more accepting and loving towards your fellow r/bitcoin users on here, without feeling any need to ever insult those of us who do not have much faith in bitcoin

thank you for your consideration in what is hopefully our shared goal of an even better bitcoin subreddit!!!

:)

p.s. As for you saying...

>why we think there's more upside than downside in the long-term.

some on here feel there is more upside, some feel bitcoin is crashing hard never to re-cover.  Its not just ONE opinion that exists on here! 
Let's see ..... 90% of trading on shady Chinese exchanges with no addresses and 60% of trades using Tether, which is from a company that refused to be audited.

Of course it's not a scam.  It's "safe money".  LMFAO :)
Can't scale? wtf you talking about? We solve scaling drama last year already. If you think all payments should be done on base layer, then please go to BCash as their community and roadmap is more suited for you.
so pow change. Miners don't change the rules but user does. Any user can be a miner. Where were you last year during the 2 year scaling drama? I thought everyone knew this already about users are in control. If you think miners should be in control, BCash is your place.
That's been addressed by a new protocol to assign the reward. See how out of the loop you are? Get schooled in crypto and come back.
Well, it is unfortunately true.

I can understand you being in denial, it is ok.
I see it more of a liquidity problem than manipulation (i'm sure there is some but not like every whale is on a united front to pump and dump at the same time) and over time that would resolved itself with better and more secure and transparent exchanges that the market prefers than the shady ones. All part of price discovery in the early stages.
So why do you consider it an obvious scam? You still haven't answer that yet. I don't mind your opinions but screaming scam without a followup (if you think it's greater fool theory,etc) just portrays you as troll initially even though you're not one. 
Funny.

You guys bragged about the "huge investments in hash power" all the time and now claim that users can take back control?  

You and I know very well that is bullshit.
Oooooooooooh.

Please enlighten all of us on how a "new protocol to assign the reward" can address a 51% attack.

It's ok for you not to respond as you clearly have no clue what you are talking about.
You agree that you're lame? Great. Let's call it a day. If there's a way to revisit in 5 years I'd be happy to send you a 'I told you so' message, but I'm saying it now in advance.
>bitcoin itself isn't the scam
but there are whales and syndicates that pump and dump, and manipulate the price

>so... its a VERY shady marketplace

>once people realize what a crooked system it is, they won't want to deal with it (especially with so many people losing so much - basically anyone who bought in late 2017 or all of 2018 has lost money - who wants to deal with that?)

>Regular people don't want to deal with such a shady and *heavily manipulated* marketplace
you haven't heard of betterhash in development? Guess we know who is the clueless one.

Sure! ..First of all, a 51% attack is 'possible' but not probable. You can't take anyone's money using a 51% attack, you can only spend your own. Plus it only takes one miner to refuse to accept any block that seems malicious.

As for the protocol, you won't find this on your news sources, it's from the Bitcoin Core Developers. Matt Corallo has proposed BetterHash to replace Statum, the current protocol. Instead of allowing the mining pool to decide who gets the work, the miners can pick and create their own blocks. There's a lot of technical details to this, and I'm not sure if you're serious or trolling. So honestly I am not sure you'd understand this ...not an insult, most people don't.
You obviously have a language comprehension problem.

Alright, since you hardly understand the topic, let's call it a day.  
"Development" ..... lol, is this the best you can do?

And the concept is already obsolete before it can even be implemented.  Let me give you a clue - centralised ownership of mining farms.  The two largest pools (btc.com and antpool) are both controlled by Bitmain.

Gone are the days when it's truly decentralised and mined by users.  It's now a business and owned by the Chinese.

Try not to call someone clueless unless you know what you are talking about.  Otherwise, you end up making an ass of yourself.
Oh please .... BetterHash works for public pools.  But when pools are centrally owned such as Bitmain, it's useless.

PoW change as tofuspider suggested?  Try doing another fork and see how fast an organization like Bitmain, with plenty of resources, can adapt.

The point is - there is little that is unique to a large group of decentralised users that cannot be replicated into a central pool controlled by a single business entity.
Are you always so impatient? Development takes time with security as priority.

Once again, if you hate it so much and it failed in mining and retail adoption, why still in this sub if you see no future for it?
Public school? Wha? What are you smoking? You are literally trying to regurgitate portions of information that you squandered from God knows where and make it sound like you understand this stuff. Ha ha this is hilarious!!!
This time, you've really shown you have no clue at all. I could accept that you accused me of watching gurus on Youtube or whatever shit you were going with there, because that seems to be something you do. But for you to assume you know more than anyone who spends day in day out reviewing blockchain code is .... is nothing less than insanity, and you should really go back to whatever it is that you may have some limited comprehension of.
Ha ha ha ha my God I'm still laughing at that last comment. You cant even grasp the difference between owning 51% hardware and a 51% attack. Do you even understand what the scare tactics media are referring to when they release the shit articles you've been reading about a 51% attack?? Have you ever written a line of code in your life? 
Anyway this got to stop before I start thinking everyone out there is a non technical as you.
Later man .... troll the little reddit section all you want. I am now convinced that anyone who could be possible naive enough to hold ANY ounce of weight in your FUD comments are not needed in this community yet anyway.
You should message direct Matt Corallo or Jimmy Song and give them your input on 51% attacks. They could use a good laugh, ha ha ha ha ha.
Impatient?  That's rather weird coming from a person who claimed that BTC is "sound money" and users are in charge when they aren't.

The entire concept of decentralisation sounds good on paper but it's not implementable when there's real money involved.  PoW change?  How long do you think it will take for a company with plenty of resources like BitMain to adapt?
Sigh ....

When you control 51% of the hash power, you can build a longer chain that includes corrupted block (including removing a transaction) and replace the blockchain with yours.  Is it that difficult to understand?

As for BetterHash, the distribution of work and pool becomes irrelevant in a private pool where both the pool operator and miners belong to the same entity.

Lol ... technical?  Like I said, if you think crypto is cutting edge tech, you are way way out of depth.
