Daily Discussion, June 30, 2018 -- TITLE
Genuine question: I’ve been following bitcoin news for almost a year now, so far It looks like it’s quite rare when people were able to justify prices going up or down, not even in a hindsight, very few times (I can think of one only actually) that people were able to link an event to price movement, and yet most of the time it was debatable.
With that said, the fact that we aren’t able to explain events that already happened and all, how on earth people talk about predictions, and expect anyone to take it seriously?
If we can hold at least 6300 for all of today and validate this current level we might have seen the bottom. Hopefully not a dead cat bounce back lmfao
Bitcoin will very likely bubble up and drop many times during the next few years. For the tiny percentage of people that got burned and turned there are still far more people who are only now considering a modest investment in the crypto space to catch potential of the next bubble.

Therefore, whether you are pessimistic or optimistic on Bitcoin price movement, you will eventually be right.
Very nice to wake up and see some positive action for a change, long may it continue.
Talk about blatant price manipulation on the Chinese exchanges .....

KEY - Market cap $72m but Daily Trades $286m (90&#37; of it for BTC).

"Fly by Night" exchanges springing out of nowhere, each bigger than GDAX - [ZB.COM](https://ZB.COM), Coinsuper, Bibox, .....

Anyway, as long as they are helping to pump up the price of BTC, I'm fine with it.
wtf happen in the last 24-48 hours to make it go back up again ?
So far the low of 2018 is about 5700.  If that's as low it gets then the haters are in for some serious cognitive dissonance

I don’t need to check Coinmarketcap. I just come here and check the comments, if it’s positive, then I’ll check CMC. If it’s negative, I just downvote all the FUD because fuck you I love Bitcoin.
Just checking in, are you all doing okay? 
What's everyone favorite place to watch the live charts?
any sort of short term analysis of bitcoin is laughable. the price is clearly controlled by major players buying and selling. unless you have a direct line of communication with these people, your price projection means dick

Is this the Calm before the Storm? ...any thoughts guys?

u/Moosecountry05 - 3y

With over 300 million in Venture Capital Funding for Bitcoin, all the new innovations and big players about to move in from the wall street and the start ups we don't even know about yet that are being worked on. I feel like everyone is playing hush hush, and one morning we all will wake up to a huge media blitz on how bitcoins being traded for over 1000 on the stock markets and other country's are joining the band wagon and push it up to 2,000. There's so many people in high places that have invested into Bitcoin that they would be able to push it mainstream to get back there money, just a matter of when.

In my uneducated opinion, it is very unlikely to hold for a long period of time at stable prices. Investors are terrified of bear markets as they don't want to see their money shrink. But as soon as the bear market finishes- and there is stability- the fear will disappear and investors will rush in. As soon as they start to do this, signs of a bull market will appear, causing even more investors to rush in, creating a virtuous circle (for those of us who got in before anyway), causing the next in a long line of bubbles.

A Taxonomy of Bitcoin Users

The Techbros (see also The True Believers) - they're really into the internet of everything.  They think analog money is antiquated.  They're digital 24/7 and money should be no exception.  They're huge believers in the future of blockchain and can nerd out in the technology all day long.  Hodlers highly present. Subset of Techbros are the True Believers that think Bitcoin has the power to change the world, right all wrongs, create equality where there is none.

The Criminals - Bitcoin is merely utilitarian.  It allows easy transfer in exchange for contraband.  It provides an avenue of commerce for all kinds of illicit behavior from illegal drugs to sex trafficking to terrorism to money laundering.  

The Day Traders - they're not in it for the tech, they're in it for the rush.  They couldn't care less about blockchain (hell, they might not even understand it). They see a volatile asset that can be exploited for gain.  It could be oranges for all they care - anything that moves this fast can be profited off of if you know how to play the game.

The Hedge Funds - Institutional traders that agglomerate huge sums of capital that can be then used to manipulate markets.  It's a market and they're going to be present because they can move it or because they can manage the risk.  

The Libertarians (see also former Goldbugs, and Trumpkins)- fringy right-wingers that distrust central banks, and really, government of all kinds.  They think money should be deflationary and hate the idea that central banks can "print money" and undermine the value of their cash.  For some reason the idea of storing wealth in other assets that rise in value never occurs to them and they often confuse assets with money. They're highly resentful that trades in bitcoin are taxable events and hold things like "taxes are theft".  The extreme libertarians trade in conspiracy theories about jews and global banking.  In a prior generation they would have been advocating for return to a gold standard - this is the new gold standard to them.  

The Black Hats - Anarchists (left and right) that want to burn the system down.

Aunt Sally - Aunt Sally doesn't know anything about bitcoin really, but she's heard people talking about it and she's curious enough to put some money into it.  Aunt Sally has a lot of questions.  She's a little disappointed in you right now.

FOMOs (see also bandwagonners) - *sigh* these are lambs lead to the slaughter.  They see people around them getting fabulously wealthy instantly and want in.  They tend buy at the steepest part of the chart on the way up, and sell at the steepest part of the chart on the way down.

The Ruskies - Russians are exceptionally adept at identifying any weakness in western hegemony and then driving a wedge into it.  Bitcoin provides yet another avenue to throw a stink bomb into the system.  Their use is purely exploitative.  
 Btc back to $3000 I'll lick McAfee tits 
cant understand the porn partnership....verge did it to and look verge now ..the same thing will happen to tron...the price is only dropping even the price of btc goes up
I have $560 in VirWox that I need to turn into $500 worth of BTC (0.078) but I am unable to do so. I think their 2-step conversion piles up too many fees. What should I do? I could withdraw it into Skrill/IBAN for $1 but am not sure what the next step would be.

How long are we going to be stuck at exactly $6335? Why'd the volume just drop?
Tumbleweeds.
Futures, derivatives trading and day traders with no balls are causing this bear market. 
YES! They brought back the gdax color scheme on Coinbase pro.  I hated the new colors there. 
Was drunk last night and drank a bunch of coffee, word to the wise, don't post about bitcoinon Facebook if your family and relatives is clueless. Was making manic posts, copypasted GETFUCKEDBARTBOYS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!GETFUCKEDBART and THISPUMPISFORREALBRINGONDABULLLLLLLLSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSMOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!! etc. 50 times in a row and then 20 times each, and my aunt called my mom at 3 in the morning (she's across the country) because she thought I was having some kind of mental breakdown lmfao.
Now is your chance to sell and cut your looses, dont cry tomorow when it drops.
If you purchased on November 6th, 2017 (8 months ago)

You have made zero money with your investment.
BTC's price is now mostly propped up by shitcoins:

[https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/volume/24-hour/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/volume/24-hour/)

Look carefully at the wash trading.  Biggest pair is now BTC/KEY at $422m per day!  KEY's price went up 400&#37; within last few days and is used to do NOTHING other than to Buy/Pump BTC.
FOMO caused the price increase but it is artificial and will return to sideways movement.
July 1st is supposed to be bull season start according to some rumours around the internet: how accurate can this be? Is the latest price rise an effect of this prediction?
Here, have some optimism. You're welcome.
wow, that was a short "bull run"

LOL

heading down again

:(
Uh oh, I don't like what I'm seeing now. It hasn't been able to stay above 6,400 too long. Now it's going into shaky mode. Looks like it's about to go into another dip. :(
So, time to short?
Why is Bitcoin so conservative with their technical upgrades. Bitcoin said at 1mb so miners don’t have too much power over nodes. Miners will always be there no matter what. They just chase the auto issuance of bitcoin every 10 minutes. If they drop out, difficulty adjustment takes place. Do miners aren’t that significant. They do as told. 

Segwit came out over a year ago. Why can’t nodes who control the consensus rules, mandate segwit?! It’s going to happen eventually; it’s better tech; it’s needed to scale for Lightning. It’s only at 40% after s year!!

Why? Bitcoin is developing at a snails pace in a rapidly evolving world. Mandate Segwit! Get Lightning operational so when Bitcoin gets its second chance this November, people are paying $50 fees again! 

Bitcoin will only get a certain amount of chances for the masses to test it.

It’s like a total human nature thing to be able to control things by making them able to predict. When we can’t do that we flip out and identify something as “volatile” or “unpredictable”.

Herd behaviour.  Baaaaa.
Well, temporary bottom anyhow. I remember when the "absolutely will not go below floor" was 12000, then 10000, then 9000 then 8000 then 7000 then 6000 the last couple of months before it busted below that last week.
Futures settled yesterday
Regression to the mean
nothing. I'm starting to wonder if the exchanges just do this amongst themselves to spur activity.
Payday?
FOMO
'So far' 😂

That low happened this week mate
Everyone thought the February low around $5900 was the bottom. There was constant talk about how several months of fluctuations in the $7k to $12k range meant that it could never ever go back below $6k ever again.
Well, when you consider that for 2018 the drop was about 13000 then that 5700 doesn't look so hot, i.e., at 6500 the price of BTC is about half of just the drop. But don't fret, still some good mileage downhill yet to go!
And still, no one that has commented knows didly about anything that may happen or even why

Uh, that was before the crash and it got a bad name, which is why it has continued to generally decline. Assets after a bubble bursts usually become nearly worthless over time, which is why they are so safe to short.
Sounds like a plan.  My balloon 🎈 will be departing for moon at 9k sharp whenever we get there.  Do not be late. 
Just move your coins to cold store.  Mine has been there for a long time.

I doubt if you will be hearing any real good news for next couple of months (other than "bulls r back" whenever it goes up $100).
Yep. Heat wave is scheduled to end over the weekend. Hopefully the weather guys got their crystal balls calibrated recently.
Great! lebron just landed in Los Angeles to meet with my favorite team the lakers, I’m going to have rib eye steak tonite, and Bitcoin will surge soon

BTC's price is now propped up by dozens of shady Chinese exchanges that did not exist last week and using shitcoins like SelfKey (stupid name).  It is the last mile money grab before it all collapse.
“Grandpop (grandmom), you could have owned a whole Bitcoin? Why didn’t you get one? Why do I have to deal with  the bank still and my friends never have to grandpop?”
Smart move, i did the same.
Are u da smart boi?
Right? Nothing to see here. Now just move right along. 
Hey, is that my pool guy speaking? Sure sounds like him. Somebody ask him if he invested in Iraqi dinars too (my pool guy is going to get mega-rich on them when they RV next week, which has been going on for six years now).
Meh. As scams go, this one is pretty low effort.
Or not. I'll go with that one.
OK got it so you love Bitcoin and agree that it will be the next generation's go to as a currency and digital store of value on a secure and stable blockchain network maintained via open source code contribution. Awesome.
But what about purple people?
Tsk.  You didn't mention the LGBT community.
Clearly you have strong opinions on libertarians.
Never ever use skrill for any kind of money movement. Those guys just freeze accounts and take the money and rebrand if the fud is to big. Happened to me
That's a 98% chance of a Lambo right there
Wow - is this place dead? Where'd everyone go?
This is fake pump. Gonna drop soon. 
[deleted]
you weren't?
Welp I dont want to be next to you if the price crashes.
No losses if you bought at 5900 looks you were supposed to
Maybe, but I think it will still make one run towards 7000 before falling back squarely into the mid-5000 range for a couple of months. It may not get to 7000 but should at least get to 6800 or something.

\[This will probably be the pump before the next dump, but the effect will be the same.\]
Ah to be at zero....it's a beautiful thought
Reminds me of 2014 when I was buying every payday and the price did nothing but go down. 
House of cards. 
Sorry for your loss, [how hard did you get squeezed?](https://gyazo.com/0e85c6e81063bd9f4223f4cc977c9ab4)

Reading through your comments, they are 100% FUD.

Edit: spelling
Its not fomo, its market manipulation.
It's always *next month*.
No one knows.  No one. 
The bear market started as soon as people could short the market with futures.  Before then you could only sell Bitcoin if you owned it, 
there were always more buyers than sellers... so you had to pry it from someone's hands that wanted it.  People who didn't believe in Bitcoin simply didn't buy any, there wasn't another option. 
The market will turn around when they (the shorters, non believers) don't feel safe in that position anymore.  Our Friday night jump was short position contracts expiring.  Last Friday of the month at 4pm est.
6pm est tomorrow night futures trading opens again.  If people get back in their short positions, price will continue to fall.  
It is rubbish.

BTC's price is now artificially sustained by shitcoins on the Chinese exchanges.  Without them, BTC will crash to oblivion.  You can say that BTC is now in intensive care section and can collapse anytime:

I've been hearing this too. July is supposed to be a lit month.

Or are is the rumor mill just gonna kick the can a bit further until we are in autumn? 
Just a bounce. We should not even be talking bull run until 6.8k is broken.   Next milestone after that is the psychological 10k.   Once we breach 12k all hell will break lose and we will truly be in a new bull run that surpasses the last ath. 
Bitcoin: $6,356

Feels like: $7,202

Light chance of bear encounters.
uh oh better get maaco
Volume is suuuuuuper low, too... Remember what happened last time we had 2.5k - 3.5k volume? I think we're headed for another dive here. 
They have to be conservative. Bitcoin is something that would have a failure profile way worse than rocket science - you absolutely can not take any chances with it or have your work be anything less than perfect.

It's dropped below 6000 and bounced back twice within 24h. Maybe this is it. 
This and a little short squeeze.
Relatively a noob Question... But what is a decent resource to track settle dates of Futures? Thnx in advance...
missing out on what? even people that are tech savvy have issues buying and selling crypto. jo mama on main street doesn't GAF about it. it's not FOMO if people don't care, it's artificial. it's the 12 year old that lies about everything he has, because he actually has nothing.
It's 2018 and it's $6k.
2021 !! 
Dude we going to fly and that is that. Just accumulate as much as you can during this period and you will be rewarded. ETFs coming up, custody solutions coming up. 2018 is going to be the year of turnaround.
Whats the escape velocity of your balloon to reach the moon in time?  
Speaking of shady Chinese exchanges can anyone tell me what happened to Lakebtc they just fell off the face of the earth with my bitcoin. Has anyone else had this problem.
I don’t care about price!!!! The technology is sitting there in a self. Bitcoin hardforked to people who don’t like segwit and people who do. Bitcoin chose  segwit!! Fucking implement it! No more snail  pace . It’s needed. Make it happen. It’ll be a better product. 
You are short term thinker. Bitcoin will get one more shot but the technology is the same as December. It’s indefensible. 
This sentence has probably already happened.
not really, just taking a guess. 
There is a better chance of price going down ~10% after a ~15% price increase than price going up another ~10% after a 15% increase. If price will be flat for a few days, then it will be hard to say and i might rebuy.
No, and what are purple people?
you didn't include the "Q"

shame on you!!!
I'm sympathetic to libertarianism-lite (or classical liberalism) that favors a lighter governmental touch and freer economy. I think the brand of libertarianism that favors no regulations, no central banks, thinks that taxes are theft. . .etc. etc. is a load of fucking nonsense.  
Lol!
It's night in Europe and Asia, late business hours in Americas and early morning in Australia. In other words, everyone is either sleeping, driving to work or driving from work now.

Gdax color scheme equals Lambo?
hahahaahha just hapy, may have posted some CENSORED pics of Bart getting gangbanged, made sure to use one where he was drawn fat and in his 40's cause of how stupid my countrie's laws are.
Unfortunately, I think so too.

When the number of Chinese exchanges started popping out of nowhere ([ZB.COM](https://ZB.COM), Bibox, BCEX, HitBTC, CoinBene) with each processing over $200m each (bigger than GDAX), it's the sign that the last mile money grab is here.

Anyway, I'm not selling.  My horde of coins since it was less than $200 is still where it is and will remain there.  
“Redditor for 3 months”
I thought you said no one knows, yet you talk like you know. Oh, I see. You must be no one.
Don't believe too much in theorycrafting, the trend is your best friend and this is a bear market. Proceed with extreme caution when buying. Best to sell rallies (short sell)
He is right.
Maybe lightning network is a good Doctor
It already collapsed in the last 6 months. Where you been? Now is actually the time to accumulate.
LMFAO
Next week's forecast: Partly sunny with a chance of bears
But segwit is going to implemented 100%. Everyone knows it will. Why delay the inevitable when it fails to scale when too many users try it out. 
Only noob question is the one you don't ask:

Who really cares?  While we are still day dreaming of adoption, use case as a currency is already obsolete.

e-payment systems is already a $5T market.  And that's for real goods and services transactions, not all these fake trading on exchanges.

You really need to be more aware of the larger Fintech movement rather than holed up in BTC watching silly YouTube videos.

https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/08/china-is-living-the-future-of-mobile-pay-right-now.html

Wake up.  Nobody cares about an 8 year old "technology".

People cares about ease of making payments and the next generation e-payment systems are so advanced, it's causing grief to the banks.

http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2106105/big-banks-fear-theyre-losing-ground-chinas-fintech-giants
You maybe right cause the technology is there but not implemented. I’m using common sense here: segwit is developed but only 40% implemented after a year. It’s going to be implemented 100%. Why bitcoin nodes allow bitcoin to let a great technology that was rejected by people who moved to centralized Bcash, not be mandated is unconscionable. Makes no sense. 
I agree - after a 15% increase a 10% is more likely than a 10% rise... Until it's not
How do you know?
.. or wimmin!
Every Ron Paul/Ran Paul libertarian that I've ever met was definitely b@tsh!t crazy. Don't know if they were dropped on their heads, or got some bad ganja that destroyed key braincells, or if they have just spent so much time outside that the sun finally put the zap on their heads, but they were totally nutso.
The chart interface truly sucks compared to GDAX, Volume is half across all pairs compared to Gdax...a not so stellar debut and I hope they fix this or they will go the way of Bitterex.
Totally normal response to an investment posing 5% gains. 
> “Redditor for 3 months”

Wow, you got me there, buddy!
Lol ... it's not the price, silly.  It is the flow of money.

I call this "transfer of wealth":

* USD in America -> BTC
* BTC -> Shitcoin
* Shitcoin -> Tether 
* Tether -> Cash out USD in China (through OTC).
Thnx!

Everything you said is centralized. Bitcoin is closest to decentralization in hundreds of years. I wish I could tell you what I hear every day. The government owns you all through centralized banking. It’s sickening what I hear. 


We need segwit, we need Lightning, these technologies cannot sit on a shelve and not be used. The more people use this decentralized bitcoin, the freer we become and can spread that freedom. 40% segwit adoption and Lightning not having devs doesn’t scare the government. 

If bitcoin got its act together, you have no idea the fear it would send them and we only have 2 years cause this administration likes bitcoin and didn’t expect to be here. The sec chair is on board. We continue to fail the technology. Mick mulvany controls the USA budget and why isn’t bitcoin using segwit or Lightning so far behind. Andreas Antonopolous needs to stop idealistic talk and start telling people, this is mankind’s last shot at freedom. 
Segwit is a year old ass. It’s just upsetting they don’t use a great technology. 
Everyone who hates segwit are in Bcash. Bitcoin exist it it’s current state with people who support segwit and Lightning. MANDATE IT. Make Bitcoin a better currency and the miners you all fear will mine bitcoin cause it’ll be a better product with users and profitable to miners. Step up nodes. Enough is enough. The world moves too fast to allow this bullshit delay. Bitcoin will get one more chance. If fees go up and they will cause the technology hasn’t changed in a year, people will not try it again. That’s why it’s going to be grandchildren cause we have no faith this generation can implement segwit when everyone wants it. 
The USA government moves faster which is amazing cause we move slow as shit. 
He doesn’t.
He’s playing odds
The lunatic tin-hatter wing of libertarians has really sullied the entire party.  I have no tolerance for that nonsense.  
Wow he got you good! That man has no mercy!
Sorry but you have no clue about economics and the global financial system.

What do you think is allowing the average Americans to have a high standard of living and powering the growth of its industries since WW2?
Like I said, it's not the technology.

You just can't use a currency with prices that fluctuate like BTC.  You may not care about BTC's price but merchants do.  They can't re-price their goods and services by changing it every few hours.
i don't
How does he calculate the odds?
Printing money that NATO countries were forced to adopt cause it was backed by gold and no one had an issue cause of gold backing. Nixon canceled the gold standard and said trust USA than he resigned. Feel good? Cause we didn’t.

In this market, profit taking is rampant
Listen, moron.

The awful truth is because you can't afford a gold backed dollar.  America didn't have enough gold to back it's currency.  As a country, it was and is still bankrupt.  And it's not NATO (that's a fucking military organization).  America owes other governments through issuance of bonds and the biggest holders of America's debt are China and Japan.

It is because of the international trust in the dollar (and the nice interest that it pays) that America is able sustain it's debt driven economy.  An economy with 5&#37; of the world's population but consumes 24&#37; of the world's resources.  An economy that produces morons like you who takes things for granted and can afford to speculate in BTC, hoping to get rich.

You want to sink the USD and replace it with BTC?  Let me tell you what will happen before that - hyperinflation and sky rocket interest rates.  Leading to American companies going bankrupt as they no longer can afford the cost of capital, leading to unemployment.  And eventually leading to total collapse of the American economy.

Feel better?  Now fuck off as you have no fucking clue what you are talking about.
You are clueless.
Coming from a moron that has no clue what he is talking about. You project a lot. Your rhetoric wreaks of either buttcoin or finance subs. I'll give it to you though, your rambling mouth drool you do sure is entertaining. Takes a special kind of stupid to be as persistent as you are. 
Buttcoin?  Lol ... the very fact that you even bring this into the topic shows that you are way of depth.

Probably another loser belonging to the bottom 25% with negative equity.

Sorry, no time for you.  Putting you on block list so don't bother to reply.
