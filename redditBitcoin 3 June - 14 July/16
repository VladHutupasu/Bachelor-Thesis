Literally none of you know what you are talking about.  You are all guessing.
Candle straight to 100k 
"Poor. Poor never changes." - Ron Perlman
When are they going to realize Bcash is shit that leads down a pointless centralized path!!  It must go if bitcoin is going to be successful. It erodes the trust of bitcoin. Adds confusion to a confusing market. All just to make 10 people rich. Ver has to pay for his crimes of bait and switch and hope the state department and Japanese embassy finalize a deal. 
My TA :

We're looking at an adjacent Albertein straight Line just above the Fintak vector. If it goes towards a 46degree vertigo we can expect the unexpected by expecting it to be expected. But none of it is going to happen if we cross the Krudabi zone where all the Kurntoff conglomerate.
Man just look how fast sentiment switches....
When we all be screaming "shit is shooting through the floor", then it will be bottom. Let it fall. Same situation at December.
Lol how happy everyone is now, when everyone was depressed at that same price it is now 2 weeks ago. 
"This is good for bitcoin".
If we can get past 6800 this whole thing could turn around really fast into a mega bull run. 
7k by sunday 4 pm pst. ama
Upvote if you're watching price action live. Would be fun to watch a big jump here but getting some strong sell-offs right now. Hope it holds 6400.
Love watching shorts get rekt!!
A friend of mine got me into bitcoin back in December, listened to him (silly me) and invested some of the money in it. Realized later I made a mistake but didn’t want to sell. Started learning technical analysis, reading books about trading and watching TA videos, then started price averaging at 12k, 9k, 7k... Ended up putting more money in. Overall still at a big loss. Of course not going to put any more money in it. I think it’s stupid to dump your money into something when you lose money and can’t even break even. I mentally said good bye to all that $$$ and now just going to hold. I believe btc will reach some even lower numbers and might be stuck there for a couple of years. Of course we all hoping to get bullish but only time will show. From my lesson I learnt: don’t put more money in it if you are already losing money. 
Who here has been in this since the last top in 2013?  did you sell any in 2017?  My general impression is that most people don't time this market well, usually they sell too early and buy back in too early or sell and never come back only to check the price a few years later and regret.  Why would this time be any different?  We could be in for a prolonged bear market but that doesn't mean this is going to die out.  The history of bitcoin already is a fascinating story, do you really think this is how it ends?  If so, Hollywood won't be able to make a blockbuster movie about it, not enough has happened to impact the world yet.  
The more FUD the better for Bitcoin, I really believe that it's a black swan event and what doesn't kill makes it stronger and we know nothing will kill it
bullrun
$250 jump in like 15 minutes

Yet another Bart Simpson incoming ?
When Moon / Lambo?
Fake pump
[deleted]
BTC failed to hold the critical support level of $6000 yesterday. what you think about its drop in the coming days ?  
Is GDAX just like Coinbase but without the 1€ fee per purchase? I wanted to set up a small weekly buy order with my credit card, but the Coinbase fees would pretty much ruin it.

All will be fine.  
When the moon is in the 7th house and Jupiter aligns with Mars, bitcoin will go back up.
Bulls are back!
WTF IS HAPPENING
Boooom!
We are mooning
bullrun
Why any sudden upward movement has to be called “bull run”? Maybe we should call it “bull walk” until it really starts running. 
Look at that healthy organic growth..
This is a good day for Bitcoin !
Daily Hopium:


I bet this guy regrets the decision he made five years ago:

/Bitcoin

I don't want to screw anyone, but I have to get off this ride. When this post is two hours old I'm selling off >800 BTC

u/fauxmosexual

I really believe in the future of BTC, I invested nearly all of my life savings in it, and after MUCH soul searching I realised I have to get off this crazy ride. Fortunately if the current price holds I'm not losing too much, but I can't afford to risk any further losses. I NEED to convert back to standard currency. I've made a fool of myself, cost me and my family too much because of my greed and delusions, and I'm at the point where I have to cut and run.

This community has been great and although I haven't participated I've lurked a long time and have been staggered by the willingness of people to put their money where their mouth is to change the world for the better. I'm really sorry to do this, but I have no choice but to sell off >8000 BTC which may be enough to spark another panic sell off. I don't want you, my fellow /r/bitcoiners, to be left holding devalued BTC so to clear my conscience I'm giving this community a few hours warning.

I will begin my sell-off at 0500 GMT, which will lower the price significantly. If you plan to get off this crazy ride anytime soon you may like to consider doing so before then, or be prepared to hold your BTC for the long haul. Please upvote this post for visibility (I recieve no karma for this self post) but I would appreciate it if you don't blog, twitter, or share this outside of the community. I want to give my fellow redditors a chance to sell but I don't want to crash the market before I do. Please keep it within reddit, thanks.

Please accept my deepest apologies for what I am about to do to the bitcoin market.

e: I can't change the title, it was meant to be >8000

The price will go up if idiots stop selling positions every 10 minutes. Being overly greedy is hurting the crypto economy. Dumb millennial hipsters who think they are the next Ray Dalio with their TA they just learned 3 months ago. 


1. If you HODL (for 20 years) eventually it might go up. You might be dead by then though.

2. Just like MySpace, a newer, better crypto will come along and unseat the dominance of Bitcoin. However there will be 10,000 different coins out there and they will all be worthless because there is no 'gold standard' of coinage.
This is good for bitcoin /s

All these posts of hodl and buy the dip and to the moon and support and i bought more because blablabla 

YOU ARE ALL WRONG AND DELUSIONAL 
i am a FOMOsexual
"This is good for BTC"
"I'm in it for the tech"

o I am laffin
Bitcoin price is going to shits. Not holding at 6.7 not holding at 6.2 barely holding 5.9. 
People are just cashing out for WorldCup bets. As soon as it's over they will pour their winnings into BTC starting a new bullrun.
So... GDAX is officially gone now
It's alive!!!!
Thats what im talking about!  Let that institutional money come in.  We bout to be ballin.
things are happening *generic hype*
Bought more 
cracked 6500
I’m ready 
Keep this up! Lets have a drink!
Bull trap or bull run?

Very nice to wake up and see some positive action for a change, long may it continue.  
How sad and funny it is to see people saying they're selling now...  If anything you have to be buying. Come on it's trading 101. If you're holder then just don't check the price at all. I believe they're will be a time when you won't have to cash in at all. You'll just buy the house o your dreams with the btc you held. BUT... If you're gonna trade then don't make stupid mistakes like selling in the lows. It just don't make any sense. Unless of course your stoploss simply triggers and you're accepting a certain margin of loss. 
Gonna say this, because I've never said this here..

When Lambo?
When absolutely everyone thinks its time to sell and its all over, that is the indictor that the bottom has been reached and all fingernail hangerson have been flushed out and its time to buy.

Anyone know of a good sentiment graph or survey for bitcoin?
Prediction: more sideways movement for 4-5 days as people accept sub 6k territory, maybe even a small climb back above 6k, then another dump down to 5.6k. 
Bitcoin is struggling to make it back up to its “support”.  Continued sideways movement towards 5k
Hip hip hooray 5900 again.  
The tauruses are back?
Mmmmmm. I can almost taste that lambo now!
Finally bitcoin is dead. There is no volume and 2 failed attempts to cross 6k. THERE will be drastic fall to 4k and after nothing will be there. I lost my all earnings, savings and I am now in debt. 

Bank has won the game.

Not be greedy that's what the lesson I learnt. Thanks bitcoin and I am signing off guys. It was a wonderful ride.
We're off.

If there's one thing I've learnt - never lose trust in Bitcoin.
https://www.gdax.com/trade/BTC-USD

Check the one day chart guys, if the "long" red turns to a long-green soon, that should signal a clear reversal, not TA but you can observe the pattern happening everytime futures are near / during certain periods

the length of each massive movement seems to be about 2 weeks roughly since the fall from near 10k "reversal"
My expert TA... We are looking at a 24 hour reverse Bart head forming.  Expect a $200 jump in the next 3 hours.
well this is going to correct something fierce lol
This occurs every time. Don’t worry 
Bulls are back boiz
No way we hit $5k ever again 
this is it boys, finally... its going to the moon

nothing can stop it

guaranteed

call the lambo dealer now, and make your reservation 

we are on the start of a HUGE bull run

it'll never stop this time

no way that bitcoin will ever go down again

it can ONLY go UP ⬆️ ⬆️ ⬆️

everyone in the world will be using BTC any day now.
don't look at the price boys. Its long weekend and so enjoy. 
Recently, I watched a video of Cedric Dahl talking about the moment we're going through now. If you're feeling a little desperate, maybe it would be good for you too. Here's the link:

Cedric Dahl | Are we in a "Crypto Winter"?

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9kLD5J5HsE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9kLD5J5HsE)  
So the first real tax discussions and decparations by irs etc in the us last year forced many big whales to sell to pay taxes. One study shows there are about 30% of coins now in play that had  been locked up by whales.

So of course price fell as april deadline approached.

That started a lot of margin call forced sales and panic selling.

And of course it is harder to get on exchanges at all because of all the verification now. Even bitcoin atms require verification.


So can individual buying be big enough to make big price moves like in the past with those restrictions now?

So the other big question is when will institutional money come in strong. Some already happened.

Of course the big institutional nay sayers like Jamie Dimon have now started saying everyone should have some bitcoin. I dont know if that means they were secretly buying before when they were being negative and are now selling their secret positions to the retail customer or if they are now going to be buying more. Thoughts?
I still don't think normal fibinaci rules are gonna apply when bitmain and avalon are trying cut their new american competition off ar the knees by depressing the price. DPW stock will either be the next microsoft or.the next sears depending on how long bitmain and.avalon can keep BTC price down.
How much in fees are the exchanges like GDAX making? It's hard to calculate based on transactions because they only take fees from the "taker" side of a transaction. 
Hers my TA. The price is not dropping anymore its sliding.  And whats sliding down can turn and slide up.
Why would someone be so sure BTC would hit ATH again... Nothing is forever and past behaviour is not a real signal of future results.
From WikiTextBot:

**Hype cycle**

The hype cycle is a branded graphical presentation developed and used by the American research, advisory and information technology firm Gartner, for representing the maturity, adoption and social application of specific technologies. The hype cycle provides a graphical and conceptual presentation of the maturity of emerging technologies through five phases.

An example of a hype cycle is found in Amara's law coined by Roy Amara, which states that

We tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run.
Saifedean retweeted this that gives me a better understanding of why people here are so angry about inflation.  [https://twitter.com/paul\_btc/status/1012358343355195392](https://twitter.com/paul_btc/status/1012358343355195392)
I remember hearing about something awhile ago where you can send bitcoin to someones email, prompting them to create a wallet to be able to deposit their bitcoin that was sent to them through email. does anyone have any info on this?

Futures bastards are buying back in ready for the next dump no doubt. I have just seen the market jump from 5900 usd to 6300 usd in a matter of minutes. I really hope its the bulls back, but these dumps right before futures are too obvious
Damn so hear a futures contract expires next in September?

When Moon / Lambo?

Tron thinks next Tuesday, about teatime.
ive realized btc usually turns green when im out eating drinking or traveling... 
Almost bulls rise as all turn green today
What happened to this forum? I thought all conversation was to refrain from price predictions and complaints, yet that's all this discussion has become. People constantly whining that they are down in their investment or letting everyone know they are selling because the price is crashing is embarrassing. Or, zombies asking 'when moon/lambo?' which is not even remotely humorous anymore. And, for those that claim no factual information by crying 'Bitcoin is dead', or 'mining is ruining the environment', have some dignity. You sound like assholes. Statements like these are grossly nearsighted  and paint a grim picture of where Bitcoin is headed. These comments are flat out false and driven by ignorance and fear. Dumb, uneducated, and false commentary adds nothing to the discussion here. 

It is a trap. Buhahaha. 
What we really need here is BitcoinAlways to show up and tell the bulls to come on. 
So, bitcoin still doesn't seem to be doing well. That must suck for all of you who are HODLing.
Dur I’m going to sell my 10 bitcoin and buy back in at 3k. 
It’s not even consistently above 6500 and we already have dudes nutting and talking about bull runs.
what i don't get is people saying miners will switch off the machines if it goes below $5k.... so how was it being mined when price was $1500 etc
Lmao nice fake pump 
the sad part is, the bitcoin i sold at 8k+ can easily buy back in with lol
TIME TO GET SOME CHEAP ASS BITCOINS MY FRIENDS =))))
HAHA BTC is failing lmao, all your time and money wasted :(
I am really trying to understand how it feels to put your entire life savings into bitcoin at 17,000 usd. I think I know how it feels because I bought into it at 300 usd and I didn't sell out at 20,000!!. Instead I sold all my btc at 16,500. Boy did I feel such a fool. Any how I am off for a three month holiday in Thailand in about 2 weeks time. Knowing my luck I will mistime buying at the bottom and will feel such a fool. Still the warm weather in Phuket and the other attractions there will help I suppose. Sigh...
ITs over BOYO
All forms of money used to require trusting in people in order to estimate it's supply. With bitcoin it can be measured precisely by everyone independently. 
too predictable
Bitcoin will outlive us all. If you want to worry about this low and sell at a loss, that's your call, but just remember the discussions you will be having with your grandchildren when you have those 'once upon a time' conversations :).
5k tomorrow.......and stop whining about it ,...,struggling this struggling that,.... does it goes up or does it goes down,...strong support this and strong support that,.... omfg youre al fuders.

No kidding. I think the most popular guess this week is 4K. All kinds of people are throwing that one out there. They are like I'm going to look at a few years ago and see what happened and then I'm going to make only one plan that includes the exact same thing happening again. Often times I ask them so what will you do if you're wrong? Crickets chirp

The safest way I see to play this if you have the time to do it is buy support levels and set stops on the break. If 5800 holds great you look for the higher high and higher low. If you get continuation then you can get more aggressive. If 5800 does not hold you look at 53 to 55. Get an entry on a wick and set a stop. Look for a continuation pattern. You basically repeat this process fishing for bottoms

Or if you just don't want to be bothered with trading or you have realized you're not very good at it because your emotional; cost averaging has been a great way to play markets over the years. 

I personally don't see how the fundamentals support a retrace to 4K which would be the equivalent of the last bear market but it is something that I can't completely discount so risk management has to be part of the strategy
I do. I \*know\* I'm guessing!
I do.  Bitcoin is going up, or down.  Prove me wrong.
I'll eat my own dick on national TV if that happens.
lol
Was looking at a Ver post yesterday. He was showing a new video where "he shuts up a Korean Blockstream believer" (or something like that). I watch the video and all I see is Ver arguing that Bcash is better because it can be spent like USD or Korean Won and just cut right after he's made that completely dubious argument. The answer of the Korean guy was never revealed.  
I don't like violence but Ver needs to be slapped and be told to stop his childish shenanigans.
That's dumb, you never even factored in the floating point gaussian tangential rondure.

I've never seen anything like it before. 
I'm immune.  Been in this for far too long.
Automated sentiment can switch really fast. 
It's almost like they forget they were depressed to be at these levels about three days ago. 
The shorters aren’t happy 
A jump to 6.8k will be a big morale boost to current holders. 

Doubt if it will create a bull run.  

At 6.8k, the news headline will say "BTC 65&#37; down this year".

Let's be candid - would any potential new investor pour money in an asset that lost so much in months?
> 4.9k by sunday 4 pm pst. ama


100x on Bitmex shorts ruined 4 lyfe
Just open a broader lens and relax. Bitcoin will first go dense in the countries that benefit the most from it. Then, placed under a load for another while, the developers will work out upgrade implementations like all open source software, and it will eventually make its way into more and more mainstream financial operations.   
The biggest problem with all of this is that people expect way too much too soon. The internet started with military in the 60's and took years to finally make it's way into mainstream use and then years more to accommodate large file transfers and now look at it. Bitcoin also starts with a niche group, and as it becomes more accessible and user friendly we'll be using it before you even realize.  
However, that being said, if you look at the investment more than the currency, you'll focus on the day to day token price and go mad. Hold it, buy more if you have money you can risk and wait it out. Only a fool would think Bitcoin is going away in terms of advancement over time.
That is backwards. If it was good at 12k its great at 6k
[deleted]
I haven't been here since the top in 2013. I actually heard about the crash afterwards, and started doing research into Bitcoin early 2014. I'll admit, I was **very skeptical** at first. Nonetheless, I decided to start dollar cost averaging small amounts by spring 2014. Sentiment at that time was **very** low, and quite similar to the sentiment I'm seeing now. People saying Bitcoin saying was a ponzi scheme, it didn't work, "the company" will go bankrupt, it's not secure, etc. I've heard and read it all. They all had one thing in common: a poor understanding of how Bitcoin actually works. None of those critics took any time to read the whitepaper or do any kind of research into the technology. On top of that, bear markets bring "irrational despair" just as much as bull markets bring "irrational exuberance".

If there is one thing for certain, crypto is not going away. It's a genie that has been let out of the bottle. If you're a long term holder like myself, sentiment cycles do not phase you. 
Why not ? Outside of the criminal world, bitcoin is essentially useless ? Why would it not fizzle out like a million useless products before it ? 
BTC economics is essentially a fucking flock of black swans :)
Aaaand it's over.

You mean "fake growth" because the pump IS real.
Exactly.  Everybody knows every time it goes up is a fake pump.  I'm told by hundreds and hundreds of redditors for 3 weeks that this is the case.
But this kind of manipulation hurts so good
It is simple, too many USDT pussies
I think we can reach around 5K in July. I keep some of my fund in USDT to be ready to buy when its low-low. 

Questions is, will it pass lower than 5K? 
Lol @ ‘critical support level’
Buying Bitcoin with credit is potentially a path to homeless

Bro, my TA is legend. Dead cat pounce!
It’s not s bull run until 6.8 is brikd 
more like a bull shit

its still in shitty territory, and down 70% since end of last year
That’s what she said 
And the massive dumps out of nowhere in spite of the fact that the tech is stronger than ever are indicative of organic selling? 

Plz go. 
Asia is waking up!
An even better day for the environment!! 
wat's a "fauxmosexual"?
Did he really do that? I mean, if you warn everyone that you're selling a big amount of BTC, and they sell before you, you'll lose even more money.   


By the way, this only happened because he invested money he couldn't afford to lose. 

Edit: spelling.
[deleted]
Bullshit
so the price of things will increase when there is nobody willing to sell? Pls more in depth economic analysis. 
1.  You're simply paraphrasing economist JM Keynes.
2.  BTC *is* the gold standard.  10,000 shitcoins doesn't negate that; in fact it makes a gold standard even more important.

There may be some value in your ideas, but they are not new, and are easily contestable.

It never ceases to surprise me how people come on these boards and advise us of matters that we have considered, and known about, and discussed for years :)

What will people be cashing out for after WC?
Hahaha
Yeah, it's coinbase pro now. 
Any good sites out there to see the candle charts? I've been using this lately https://cryptowat.ch/markets/bitfinex/btc/usd/1m 
you guys just keep getting suckered into every repeated pump 'n dump don't you...
Shouldn’t we anyway. This is not over. I don’t even look at fat woman 
Who cares either way right now.  I say enjoy seeing a little green, eat, drink, and be merry, for it’s the weekend.   Off to a good start. 
It’s obviously a bull something Richard 
Obviously a bull run. This is totally organic growth. Not at all a pump to wreck those that shorted. 
So does that mean it will get below $5k?
What does the Purple line mean?
But it's been this way forever. The weak are afraid to buy or even hold, the only thing they buy is the fear and give in to it. Then they react with childishness, and start throwing insults at the very same thing they were praising just a short while ago.   


It's typical human behavior and that's why the more intelligent people are risk takers and make money. They see the opportunity where everyone just sees fear and doom. Rinse and repeat - and yet some people just act like sheep and fall into pattern. Deep down everyone knows Bitcoin is going to be here longer than any of us, but it's easier to think short term and prioritize the fear.
I say let em do it, it’s natural selection 
The worst is that these people imply that Bitcoin price have some relation with it's functionality or is ecosystem. It's not like when price drops transactions get slower, or the system is suddenly insecure. Again, it makes no sense at all that people is whining like they are in this thread.
Investing 101 is also knowing when to cut a loss.
Two weeks.

Less than ten years from now
When USDT is dead only
LOL. People had the exact same thought when BTC was 8k.
Damn I should have bought Lehman Brothers then. What a missed opportunity. 
You're right - I've been too negative on Bear Stearns.  I should get back in. . .
Folks, let me tell you everyone is souring on Theranos, but NOW is the perfect time to invest
Then we will accept 4K territory
Then 3K
Then 2K

How did you do that? I mean, I lost a lot, too. But not all of it. Bitcoin is not at $0...
My greed cost me 1 year salary.
Hey you learned a lot in six months. Bye.
Dead again? Oh man I keep missing the death, that's like 300 times now. Oh well I guess you should sell it all at a loss instead of waiting to sell it on the next ATH. But wait, you're looking at a 6 month window and not a 10 year window, so you probably really believe that now .... after the vast infrastructure and global awareness, that it would actually go away? He he ... sorry man but anyone that's been watching this shit for a decade HAS to find that kind of amusing.
Ha! that's a good one sir, have an upvote. You got anymore of those doomsday intuition? Any alts i should put all my money into to make sure it crashes hard enough?
Sell so my bots can buy cheap before you leave.
It’s up from $845 January 17 to $6k in 18 months that’s phenomenal 
Hahaha wow what a fool. Learn from your stupid choices

where are we off to?
Whoever is voting me down - cool.

But if you're a Bcasher / RogerCoiner - your nasty lying coin's performance in the face of this decline has been disastrous.

You can barely hold 0.11 now  :)

Anyway, nurse is coming, so I've got to get off the phone now and back into bed.

Goodnight Bitcoiners :)
Been a long time since the last Bart 
Lol. You're the guy who said no way we touch $6k ever again about three days ago. What happened?
Hahahaha
lmao
The basic fact is  even if bitcoin only gets a market cap of gold then bitcoin will be worth $325,000 per coin.

Market cap of gold is a fringe small number. It could go much higher.

We are just in a margin call panic type sell here initialled causedby thetax guidaince given by the irs which had its firstreal impact in april that caused a lot of selling pressure.
So what if he wants to troll or throw positive spin. This thread is so full of negative experts on everything bitcoin. Oooo, I lost my precious fiat by having to sell short after ignoring all the imminent warnings. Poor, poor me. Now I’ll just gnash my teeth and criticize anyone with good news. 
My thoughts too.
Hey buddy, how much are you getting paid to troll this sub?

I mean... You are getting paid, right? Otherwise what you're doing is just sad. So sad. 
DPW?
Well there is a taker for each transaction. Maker are providing liquidity. Now depending on how much money you are moving in BTC per month you have 0,3 / 0,2 / 0,1% of taker fee. Assume that the fee per day is 0,1 to 0,3% of the daily volume. For each exchange pair available on GDAX. That’s some serious money already
Not if you are a tortoise on its back.

Just one of the many limitations of TA - counter-arguments involving tortoises.
Actually history is the best indicator of repeating patterns, and to date, nothing presents a better estimate of future patterns.  
But that being said, after 10 years Bitcoin is only now finally getting global awareness. We should all at least consider that the massive growth (NOT token price growth) in infrastructure, accessibility, etc  is just the beginning of a technology that will very likely be implemented deep into the future of finance.
Everything is a risk. Which seems more likely? The continuation of patterns we have seen for 9 years or it's suddenly stopping right this moment?
You comment is so bullish! Go against the crowd!
If past behavior were a reliable measure of future events - everyone would be rich :)
This is rearward looking and only applies go technologies that are actually adopted. It doesn't apply to ones that pop up and slowly fizzle away.

Are you honestly getting your education on national and global economy from Twitter? That guy can barely write one sentence without a mistake.

Deflation is bad for the economy. Ask Japan how happy they feel about their deflationary currency, they've been trying to inflate the JPY for over 2 decades now. Everybody looks at inflation from the point of view of the people who hoard money (not assets but actual money) and forget that while inflation causes the loss of a little purchasing power for those hoarders, deflation would lead to their unemployment and even greater loss of purchasing power. The people Paul is talking about are the first ones who are let go once revenue streams dry up due to people refusing to spend their deflationary money.

Do you know any other deflationary currencies that people refuse to spend and are HODLing because they believe it will be worth more in the future?
The only thing worse than inflation, deflation. Ask anyone how they feel about it who bought in in December. 
Probably just gonna be a Bart tbh... But here's hoping 
No, the short contracts are every month and there are at least two of them cme (last working Friday of month) and cboe (around 14th of month) both of which have shafted crypto currency since January. It's about time the authorities got on top of this clear manipulation in the US
Hmm..  This could be promising.

Have you considered embarking on a very, very long and leisurely journey whilst continually getting pissed and eating?  I'm thinking perhaps a cruise ship?

Good for Bitcoin.
Well we are at the blow-off phase of the bubble. Capitulation, I think..lol

when moon #zombie
Salty bagholders. That's what happened.
Yeah.

They banned positive talk like moon for a year  and left only those who are negative and look what has happened.

People come here to learn and see nothing but negative.

Why would anyone buy?

 Back when people could talk about moon it was fun and gathered many people. Now all the fun ones have left because they cant have fun here and they were the knowledgable enthusiasts and the only ones left are negative smack talkers.
You are dead on. I made the mistake of trying to engage in a conversation with a few of these pessimists but it's clear they just "want" to talk gloom and doom. They have no interest in wanting to learn how bitcoin could possibly have value, so they just blindly disagree with any point put forward without a shred of logic to support their negativity.

They just bash the token price or they bash LN,  or they compare Bitcoin to tupllips and the usual regurgitated BS. It's pathetic.
The daily post is only a small portion of this sub y'know?
What is your strategy?
As much as it sucks for those who sold it at a loss? HIGHLY unlikely lol. Stick around for the next 10 years and you'll see why holding is not at all a bad strategy for Bitcoin. Well, unless you desperately need the cash now!
I'll probably sell at 30-40k and buy back in at 20k. Good luck with that time machine you're building.
I sold .7 btc today at 5900. Had to pay off some debt. Was trying to sell yesterday at 6200.
And you’re telling us, why?

I don’t feel anything. ...Just do what you do you fool. 
Retards keep celebrating lower new highs.
so true

seriously

its been in the toilet for 6 months, and getting lower every month

value down 70% since last december

and idiots are to taking about bull runs?

LOL
less miners / less difficulty
The cost of mining goes up over time. The difficulty to mine bitcoins has been on an exponential rise. The network will tell us when its not profitable by reducing the difficulty. When you see one or two difficulty reductions in a row that indicates it has become unprofitable to mine for a certain percentage 
Yeah the whole idea of a fixed “cost of mining” is completely wrong 
because the difficulty was like 10 times less
lol i've only seen this literally every day since 15k. wasn't a good decision then, what makes it one now?
Not exactly wasted, that money is going to someone else's pocket.
No need to rub it in 
I think "Phuket" perfectly describes the current sentiment as well
Are you a troll?
Ooo, are we roleplaying now? I'll get my wizard robe and hat.
You big dummy. You should have hodled. 
Tut.  All that trouble to capitalise IT, then you missed out the apostrophe.
predictable would be it it had gone to 6100, this is more than expected.  (so expect a drop next week)
> Bitcoin will outlive us all.

Especially when your spouse kills you for buying at $18K.
Remember the conversations that haven't happened?  You mean remember the visions of grandeur and conversations you imagined, right?
If you *really* believe this why don’t you post a photo of yourself with your full name claiming such? Otherwise it’s pretty easy to make bold claims knowing full well if things don’t turn out you can just ditch the throwaway. You have nothing invested in your claim, you’re likely just spouting off an agenda that’s in your own best interest.

Me neither
Not if you shorted at 8k.
It will be silly to short around 6k because guaranteed you will get rekt. 
The shorters will be happy as the cme contract closed 4pm london time
Honestly even if we go to zero, that's fine with me. I wanna see some shorters get rekt first though. That's all I ask. The thought of that sick feeling in their stomachs as their collateral evaporates gives me a fucking boner. 


Short has increased this month from 20,000 to 26,000 positions.  Long is now at 34,000 positions.

So take a guess which one will get rekked first?
I did in 2013
I bought $500 worth just to feel the action about a month ago at $6,800.  This sub is a fascinating place. 
Look at the one day charts.  It would visually break the downward trend so even a newb would realize the tide had turned. 6800 is an
Important milestone 
That’s not how it works bud. Different levels of exposure, trading volume, and public interest. 
Maybe when it goes down to 6k, you were wrong about it being good at 12k?
Well I do
Do you think it's a good price to buy BTC now?
thanks for sharing! this is the kind of conversation i need.  I got really into this end of May 2017 and after digesting tons of info had no choice but to read the white paper.

Thanks for the update.  I bet you wish you did though.  
He thinks people on this sub and their 3 collective coins have the ability to move the market. 
I think he means when the idiots stop panic selling. There is a difference. 
When people can have confidence and not be scared every 10 minutes. It's a mindset. Obviously people like you don't get it yet. I can explain further if you would like.

Let's wait and see.  I think it will go up higher.

But it's amusing when price goes $500 vertical - no one complains.  But when it goes down $500 the same way, everyone here will be yelling "manipulation" :)
Nope because ima hodl my coins for years 
But, this one hasn’t unfolded yet 
I don't know. But I doubt it. I'm just showing the trendlines.

No trend lives forever.
Yeah, and I'm buying their cheap bitcoin so I don't mind
I'd say I could help a lamb make an o, but I'm not sure if that'd be legal
What is the issue with USDT?
Yes, but think about the potential long-term upside if you're willing to hold for 5-10 years or even more. The market is short term bearish for now, but most people (including "big money") are all very bullish long term. If we see a $100k Bitcoin some day (assuming an increased supply at that point to 18 million total mined coins) that would give us a nearly $1.8 trillion market cap. I think the next one or two bubbles could probably get us there. So with those assumptions in mind, buying around these prices is very much near "the bottom".
If it drops below 1.2k, the 2013 runs ath, I’d be sad
i'll prepare the $5963.56 memes
.... and time to put them back away. 
Pretty sure that’s what he said.
He leveraged by borrowing from the bank. Now what bitcoin value he has left won't cover all his debt, hence losing all his earning and saving. Honestly, having to explain this on a subreddit about trading is really telling...

"only a market cap of gold"... 

Do you hear yourself?  
1. Bitcoin is difficult to buy for the average Joe. Gold isn't. 

2. Bitcoin exchanges get hacked. Gold's don't. 

3. Gold is technically easier to understand and hold. Bitcoin isn't.

Having said that, I think Bitcoin will survive, but only as a niche store of value for its more ardent believers. 
(Heh, after my positive response he edited it, because he didn't think it was ironic  enough for me to understand his trolling.)

[deleted]
All things considered? It stopping and going to zero.  Lots more coins with better tech on the market.  What sets Bitcoin aside as the one to succeed?  The fact that it was the first mainstream one?
Of course not, because great risk can result in great reward and most average people will not sink 10k into an investment that everyone else is selling. Sure they can be aware of the historical patterns, sure they can be told that Bitcoin has crashed literally HUNDREDS of times, but that does not make them risk takers. You can't get rich by making a comfortable decision, by then it's too late. Many people have million dollar ideas but very few implement them and get a million dollars. Same reason .. risk  scares most people away.
>slowly fizzle away.

Hmmm so in ten years, that's what you see hey? I'm pretty sure that what you are referring to is the part that says "We tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run".
Well, no, my views have generally been like yours, but from this comment I realized that my thinking as an investor had always assumed a standard inflation rate of 2-3&#37; and sought assets that would have a higher expected return to adjust for this.  I wasn't thinking about people who cannot afford to invest at all.
What about the people that bought it a year ago? 5 years ago? People that are buying it now? If we are looking at Bitcoin we have to look at the whole picture, not just the hyped stage. People who never even heard of it started jumping on board all at once and inflated the price and those who bought it long before that have been taking profits. That's not a scheme or a ponzi or anything odd or unexpected. Bitcoin will most likely continue on with its growth and this will be but one tiny piece of the timeline.
I bought in December, DCA, and I feel excited about getting more Satoshis for my fiat.
D'oh!
Yeah there are many that feel Bitcoin would have been far higher now had it not been for the futures, but in the long term their influence will dissapate.
I hope this is a joke.  The whole idea behind Bitcoin is that it allows us to make shitloads of money from market manipulation.  If you can't beat them - join them!
Lmao send me out to an isolated island. Btc would moon! 
Dipping below 6000 might put us in despair territory, but for me personally, despair will be <2500 which is where price was on my first purchase. 
Buy high sell low. Always works for him.
Get out when it was good like I did.
yes, much more. those that sold at a loss could buy back in RIGHT now. Those that HODL have not options. Anyone that sold between 19k and 10k is a whole lot better off.
Or, y'know, unless it keeps going lower and lower...

Yep! I like [this indicator](https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/) personally. 


I do small buys when it’s under 20-25, and switch to small sells when it’s over 70-75. It’s worked so well I’m hesitant to even share it. :) 
I thought difficulty went up the the number of coins mined and could never go down.  Do you know anywhere that explains how difficulty is calculated? 
I've never heard anyone say there's a fixed cost of mining
Because back then, Bitcoin was in free-fall. You never buy when things are in free-fall. Never try to catch the falling knife. This is now the **third time** Bitcoin has bottomed out around these levels.
It's in a downturn. The price is dropping. You're not clairvoyant. You do not know what's going to happen any more than the holders do, you cynical, arrogant ass
I wouldn't do such a thing, but while we are on the subject of holidays, which beach on Phuket would be better this time of year Karon or Kata?
She did that to you? Damn, man! Sorry!
Yeah it's all in my head I guess ...Bitcoin is not going to make it's way into our lives as a technology that has already gathered the world's attention ...naw. Geeesh I guess I'm just crazy :)
Claim? I've been following tech for years, and have personal interest, yes .. but anyone would have to be a complete IDIOT to not see that Bitcoin is here stay. Look at the past decade, consider that most people never even heard of it a year ago, and now there's billions being spent all over the globe on infrastructure to make it more accessible. AND we don't even have wallet address translation in place for non tech-savvy users yet. This is just the beginning!!  


You really need to stop looking at the token price, because that's INCREDIBLY short sighted. WHY THE FAWK would I post a picture to support my statement? Seriously, this is Reddit. I don't give a flying crap about who believes me or who don't, I'm just stating my perspective. It just happens that Bitcoin has dropped and recovered like this over and over and that was before the global interest it has now.

I concur with your analysis 
Forgive him, he's thinks he's still in 2017.
See, you're missing the 3rd dimension.
Would anyone really be risky enough to short at 6k? Ouch.
While I'm trying my best to be optimistic, I'm also realistic about the situation.

How many times have we heard the same thing?  $18k, $17k, $15k, $10k, $8k, $7.5k, $7k, ......

This "tide has turned" narrative is getting old.
I think we're near, but I think 5100 to 5400 is very possible.  This last bit of short clearing, could (counter intuitively)  allow the price to finally settle into low 5000 range.
Depends on the original reason for buying I suppose
I personally believe that in 5-10 years, the price will be higher than it is now. So yes, if I personally had more disposable income, I would start dollar-cost averaging about now. Buy when the markets are in despair, not when they are in exuberation. Simple as that.
Every time is teatime if you love tea

>if Bitcoin rises again before you die

Ba hahha. You really believe this crap or are you just trolling. Bitcoin does this over and over because it's not only new, it's something that we need to learn how to deal with - both a currency AND an investment.Anyone that's been paying attention from the beginning is relaxed,  buying and will average down and then it will rise, and then likely fall again.It does NOT matter if it's $10 or $100,000, it's relative and it dropped almost 90&#37; a few years back. This is old news but many people here never even bought Bitcoin until a year (or less) ago lol.

The drama in here is hilarious!!

You got one thing right though - Bitcoin will be around for the time when you die, and long after.
>fallacious argument

Really?

That you paraphrased Keynes is demonstrably true.

Regarding BTC being a necessary gold standard; I made an argument in contrast to yours.  It is not for you, or anyone else, to call it fallacious.
Like so many others
first bear market?
Stevie, that's a cold shot!
Multiple issues. Primarily it is a huuuuge risk. Nobody knows is they actually have one usd for each usdt. We need an audit performed by a trustworthy accountancy firm. It might be a huge Bitconnect type scam (google : “Bitfinexed”). Besides that, it is my personal opinion the we all step too easy into usdt (read: sell) and drop the prices in mass panic with one click of the thumb. 
I would think of buying somewhere between 1000-2000$. Before that, no way. There is still too much hope here. We need to start seeing news of people loosing their houses, loosing families, suicides etc. Then it will be attractive, because people have short memories and there is a fool born every minute.

All you need to know about investing in Bitcoin is H.O.D.L. you literally can't lose. 1 BTC=1 BTC. 
not if you don't buy on margin
Nah he's too busy paying off debt
Sure.

Gold is a fringe investment that is primarily fueled by people who think the world will end tomorrow and they will need gold bars in their bunkers. Yet it is several trillion in marketcap.
Isn't the valuable metals market one of the most manipulated markets in the world?

troll?

its an obvious joke

if you are too uptight to joke in this shitty year (2018) maybe you just need to get out!
You've been on REDDIT a long time.  But mainly contributing to political forums.

Your attacks on BTC have been pretty consistent for a long time - and you've stated that you are 'in the red' despite being 'a wise investor.'

Basically, you've invested a little in BTC, lost some money, and made it your mission to FUD, based upon your own experience.

We all know the price has declined - so what's your message?

And for you to call other contributors 'cry babies' is pretty ironic !

Bitter FUDer  :)
It's all a prank, bro? 
Yeah I used the wrong terminology, not too big of a deal considering some of the grammar and writing I see in here. But yes, I am aware of the difference between Coins, Tokens & Altcoins. Enjoy the weekend!
Of course - you can't have high gains without high risk.
More like the next three years, but yes. 
And less products for your Satoshis?
I hope so mate, sooner rather than later. My suspicion is the shorters have just loaded up ready for their next dump circa 8th and 27th of July
Yes, if they are not too jaded to buy back in, on that I agree. 
I know, funny how that works out.
6500 :)
FUD?

reporting facts such as 

- BTC is down every month of 2018

- its lost 70% of its value in the last few months

- that it seems to still be losing value over all as of June 2018

No, thats not FUD

thats just reporting the facts and whats happening.

what people like you do, try to deny or silence people pointing out actual facts is the real problem

people can buy/use BTC or not, but stop criticizing those who simple point out the negative things that are actually happening right now.
Difficulty is calculated every 2016 blocks known as a difficulty epoch. The protocol compares the time it took to generate 2016 blocks and compares it to the ideal 20160 minutes (10min per block) then the difficulty is adjusted up pr down to normalize block production at 10min intervals. So if on average blocks are produced at 9min intervals difficulty will increase about 10% if 11min decrease about 10% the white paper has all the details.
It's down 3.65% today.. .8% on the week.. .and 25% on the month.

How is this not in fucking free-fall?
He's just asking people who continue to spew shit financial advice to stop... Simmer down.

Whats getting old is the narrative that is going down to a dollar lol, it has to reverse somewhere.
same reason as 99% here, greed.


Don't kid yourself. Almost everyone is here to get rich quick.  The huge drop in value is not a positive.

2. ATM's were out of cash as everyone ran to get cash. 
3. BANKS were closed with no power. As were ATM's.
4. Wifi? There was no wifi. There was limited cell service also, and we had no power in which to charge our phones unless we went to the Dunkin Doughnuts. 

So, this tells me that Bitcoin, or any other electronic coin, fails the most important test, and that's the catastrophe test. Now, for the consumer, there is no fee for me to put my money in a bank, and use a debit card. There is a fee paid by the merchant. Some merchants want cash, but most prefer electronic because it means there is less cash on hand for employees to steal, lowering their insurance risk of loss. So, merchants pay a fee to the CC processor, and also get a lowered risk assessment of theft. The old way was all cash, but you had to pay the manager much more so they didn't steal the cash and run out the door. 

Right now, I would have to pay a fee to buy bitcoin. As long as there is a fee, there is no incentive for me to incur an extra step. Plus, it's extra work. I exchange my FIAT to the bank's digital FIAT, then I take my digital FIAT and purchase digital BITCOIN, to then pay digitally to a merchant, who then takes that digital Bitcoin and converts it to digital FIAT, to then get paper FIAT. It's an awful lot of steps to go through. 

Anyway, I love the concept of bitcoin, but like MySpace, it's still just too new. Plus, there is zero inherent value in swapping my digital FIAT to Digital Bitcoin to pay at stores. Maybe in the future it will, but as Hurricane Sandy proved, CASH is still king.

Yeah, that’s a drag!

Scam stuff aside, isn't that how an exchange works? I can do the same on gdax with USD. Untill people actually start using and making it available to the general public it's kinda just there to trade imo. Where I live there is nothing I can do to make crypto other then trade and manage nodes, and there isn't much in the way of spending crypto except for on other cryptos so I just kinda keep on accumulateing as best I can (been losing more lately) It would be nice if I could use it to buy gas or groceries and until that happnes people have to exit one way or another or just wait forever which for most people is super hard. 
Loosing is not losing ffs
i'm saving this :D thank you!
Lmao look around you. Everyone is obsessed with the price because they want to cash out an investment, either now or later. Nobody is using BTC as a currency, especially with this volatility.
And if real life goods and services were priced in BTC you didn't lose any purchasing power!  Oh wait, nothing is priced in BTC besides other crypto.
Gone from 20 k to < 6 k. Can't lose!
If gold is fringe than what is Bitcoin?
Gold was traded long before cans of beans...
Yep, troll.

And you should declare your edits.


yeah, right

yo mama a prank, bro

wait, i mean a skank

LOL
No, like most people, I'm still living in the fiat world, like most people and unlike u/Bitcoin-Yoda , bitcoin is just one small part of the picture.  If I lose, I won't have lost enough to regret all the entertainment from this obsession.
I don't disagree. Organic growth will render the impact of Futures manipulation as the people involved will become a much smaller piece of the pie. This seems kind of inevitable given the huge upward trajectory hat Bitcoin has been on this past 10 years. The only questions is how soon will more average Joe's want to own a small piece of the action for that 'just in case' moment and how soon will institutional investment start flowing in. I see this point of entry as attractive in terms of price, but public perception may need a little more time.

You are actually actually right about the actual 70%.  Did you say 70% - 70 per hundred?  70/100 X?

You're not making it clear enough for me :)
"FUD" is thrown around much the same way "fake news" is.  The person is essentially admitting they have no argument, so they just label what you're saying "FUD" or "fake news" to convince themselves they don't have to pay attention to it.  
I believe you're wrong. So wrong that you couldn't be more wrong. There how's that for a nasty argument lol. I'm tired of debating this. Let everyone do their own research and so long as they are aware of what is happening with Bitcoin around the globe, they should form their own perspective. 
Just do me one favor ..stop calling Bitcoin a scheme. Perhaps there are schemes that involve the trading and manipulation of Bitcoin, but Bitcoin itself was never created as a scheme and that's one fact that can not be debated. Have a great weekend!
No one needs calculator when TAing...

lemonade?... LEMONADE???  WTF?  Why are you here?  Go back to the Nasdaq where you belong.
Googled "Tennant's super" cause I didn't know what it was. Second headline cleared it up. 

"Special report: Super-strength lager 'causing more harm than crack or heroin'"
You're asking too much I'm afraid.  I'll try not to mention it again, that's the best I can do.
I'll forgive but not forget

**Hype cycle**

The hype cycle is a branded graphical presentation developed and used by the American research, advisory and information technology firm Gartner, for representing the maturity, adoption and social application of specific technologies. The hype cycle provides a graphical and conceptual presentation of the maturity of emerging technologies through five phases.

An example of a hype cycle is found in Amara's law coined by Roy Amara, which states that



We tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run.

Ohhhh, OK I get it - you're a child. Well I tired anyway. Bitcoin is not going away. Agree, disagree, I could care less man. 

But you have to know on some level. If you really look at how some countries who can benefit from it the most have already adopted infrastructure to support it, and the massive efforts that the core developers are putting into the open source code to improve performance ,etc that this is just the very beginning. I'm not saying everyone should get rich, I'm saying this shit is not going away. Oh, and YES....100% YES history is an amazing teacher, and it does indeed indicate patterns that repeat.
You need to give it more time to evolve. Oh, and that catastrophe test you mentioned? Bitcoin has the best chances of surviving this because it's global. 

So, unless the catastrophe hit the entire world, Bitcoin would survive just fine, that's one of the many benefits of blockchain. 



>You're good at being wrong at everything.

Crikey  :)

I'm going to call your nurse and tell her you are out of bed.
I know, I've let our love go bad
Sorry, not my first language..It happens.
get ready to use it

I can still buy all the shitcoins I want!!! Wewt!
And with a falling exchange rate to actively used currencies nobody in their right mind should accept BTC for goods or services.

Anyone that bought that peak is getting what they deserve. Noob tax.
ok

you're an idiot

edit: you're a double idiot

edit: you're too much of an idiot to even talk to anymore

edit: you're now blocked

edit: good night, 

edit: i don't care about you or anything you say

edit: happy now, crybaby?
Right there with you. This is a blast. Even the dark times 
You've hit the nail on the head. Until we see multiple coinbase style organisations (ie simple to use), secure exchanges, super simple safe wallets (hardware wallets built into smartphones?) and retail/institute adoption we are stuck where we are. 
Good call.  Actually, manipulation has been there since Mt Gox.
yes, value is down 70%
well, at least with fakenews, sometimes news (as reported) is fake/lies/propaganda

with people saying FUD, you're correct... its mostly those who are not in the know who throw it around
The market has agreed with me for the last six months.

Bitcoin itself is not a scheme. I'll agree with that.  The scheme is people who are thinking it will make them rich overnight with no effort. 
Don't blame you.  I'm still feeling pretty raw about it.

WikiTextBot should post this on the main thread, not only because it's great and easy to understand, but because it's the best way for many of the kids in here to actually understand what's going on in terms of the evolving tech. Take their mind of the token price before they go mad lol!

Nope.

The FIRST thing anyone does is SELL SELL SELL whatever they got in a mass panic to get CASH. Banks are about to close, there's a run on the banks. 

It does NO good to have a million in blockchain, in the USA, during a crisis because

1. Nobody will accept it
2. Everyone only wants cash.

Oh no, we scared it with the meme!
haha we're almost there!
So they lost
Heh :)
That must be the 5th time you've written it.  You're a classic case of the Dunning-Kruger effect.

And BTW, I bought at about 600 USD.  I'm 1000% up, not 70% down.  

And I'm confident it will easily hit 20k again.

Troll.
Well, in calling for my death, you've simply confirmed your status as troll.

How much did you lose buddy?  I bet you bought shitcoins and got your fingers burnt.  Personally, I'm still 1000% up.  Now how about that :)

Why am I up - because I always trusted in the tech - and didn't sell.
Why would that embarrass me? I've been ridiculed much worse by much smarter than you and yet...I feel no embarrassment. Anyway, if you had anything of value or insight based on experience or knowledge of what's going on globally with Bitcoin, I'd welcome it. Sadly, you don't.
If only you understood who you were writing to ..

Never mind :)  


You missed it
Dude, what you're trying to accomplish with this guy can not be done. You can't fix STUPID :).
Gee, thanks for all that unverifiable information about how up you are. I'm up too, by 1000000&#37;. 
[deleted]
I have a feeling you are much less important than you think you are.
You're right - I'm easily trolled.

Thx for the advice.  I'll shut up :)

I'm off for a pizza and a beer.  Cheers mate.  These are normally friendly boards. 
I have several monitors and unfortunately stuck in front of them for work commitments. Doesn't mean I can't entertain myself in here :).
Continue with your feelings.
